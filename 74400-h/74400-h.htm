<p class="ph2">A MEDITERRANEAN MYSTERY</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER I<br>

<small>IN WHICH I ORDER CHAMPAGNE</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">I&#8202; HATE the sight of those terra-cotta envelopes
that telegrams come in. They have often
announced ill news to me, and even in the
absence of ill news they bear with them an atmosphere
of emergency, suggestions of sudden action,
which is always detestable to me.</p>

<p>Bates stood by while I read the ugly puce form
which announced, had I known it, the opening of
the curious chapter in my otherwise quiet life
which I am now trying to recall and to record in
its incredible details.</p>

<p>Incredible I mean from my then point of view,
for a life and circumstances more remote from
adventure than mine were then, it would be hard
to imagine.</p>

<p>“There is no reply,” I said to Bates, who stood
awaiting instructions. “It’s Mr. Edmund coming
for a few nights. Tell Mrs. Rattray he will be here
for dinner, and see that a room is ready.”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir. And if he comes without luggage
again?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[10]</span>A little pang of a kind of jealousy shot through
me.</p>

<p>It was two years since I or Bates had seen this
ne’er-do-well brother of mine, a year since I had
even heard from him, and yet the circumstances of
his coming without luggage was fresh in this man’s
mind, there was a lightening of his countenance
at the mention of his name, and I knew well that
my dinner would be one of unwonted luxury.</p>

<p>“He can wear some of my evening things, and
give him pyjamas, and—one of your own razors,
Bates.”</p>

<p>I will not have other people using my razors or
my fountain pen.</p>

<p>Edmund had always been an anxiety and an
expense to me. He was now the only incalculable
element left in my ordered life. But Bates seemed
to be waiting for something, and it was as though
a gleam of Edmund’s endearing eyes, the crisp
curl above his forehead, the flash of his teeth
between merrily curved lips, were faintly reflected
from the expectant look in Bates’s face.</p>

<p>“Oh, and, Bates, you can bring up a bottle of
the ’47 port, and decant it carefully.”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir. Anything else from the cellar?”</p>

<p>“No,” I said. “I suppose there’s whisky and
claret in the dining-room.”</p>

<p>“Very well, sir,” said Bates reproachfully as he
closed the door.</p>

<p>“No,” I thought. “I’m hanged if I’m going
to have champagne up. He’d only expect it every
night, and he hasn’t even written for a year. Now
of course he’s only coming for more money.”</p>

<p>Then I rang the bell and Bates returned with
suspicious alacrity. “You’d better bring up a
bottle of the ’93 Pommery,” I said.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[11]</span>It was one of those delightful days in March
when there is real daylight in the late afternoon,
with a white gleam in the sky, and a wind keen
enough to make possible the indoor joys of winter.</p>

<p>The aspect of my study in my Sussex vicarage
was extraordinarily peaceful to me. When I
looked over the top of my book, as I often did, I
looked into the bright friendly eyes of a fire of
mingled coal and drift-wood. When I turned
my face half round to the left, as I also often did,
I looked across the familiar, discreet harmonies
of my room, to a long French window which framed
a view of my lawn whose grass was now smoothing
and renewing itself after the winter ruffling, of
the red footpath and the border already gilt with
crocuses; of stately trees beyond my frontier,
their bare branches showing the faint pubescence
of early spring. Among these trees were the red
tiled roofs of the village, and beyond it the Channel,
eye-grey to-day under the silver sky, and covered
with rushing “white horses” whipped up by the
steady East wind.</p>

<p>There was one long banner of smoke on the
horizon, and a few miles from shore the brown
sails of a couple of trawlers going close-hauled to
windward with the flood-tide under them.</p>

<p>All this peacefulness and beauty was, I say,
particularly grateful to me. It was like a gentle
accompaniment to the book which I was reading
with no less attention on account of this consciousness
of my surroundings.</p>

<p>I had attended a clerical meeting in the morning
and had, I suppose unwisely, said what I really
thought about some of the topics under discussion.</p>

<p>Now I was re-reading with especial interest
the chapter on “Persecution” in Lecky’s <i>Rise<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[12]</span>
and Influence of Rationalism in Europe</i>. Only a
few hours before I had seen among my colleagues
the faces of the persecutor and the heresy-hunter,
and I was undoubtedly heretical. It was difficult
to reflect that if all this had happened but a short
time ago, say in the time of my own great-great-grandfather,
these same men would have rejoiced
to see my live body roasted; that even now,
given the power and the custom, the spirit of
Calvin and Torquemada was not dead, that it still
lit the eyes of living men who could believe in
“Exclusive Salvation.”</p>

<p>After the fret, the prejudice, and the spluttering
of modern theological controversy there was healing
for my soul in the calm intellectual austerity of
Lecky.</p>

<p>Such were my preoccupations then. The academic
interests of a scholarly, well-to-do, bachelor
parson of forty-five with a hobby for homing
pigeons.</p>

<p>I had just looked at the clock and realised with
another glow of satisfaction that my afternoon
tea was almost due, when my man Bates came in
with this disturbing telegram.</p>

<p>This Edmund who was about to burst again into
the quiet routine of my life was my only brother,
now practically my only relative, and some fifteen
years younger than myself. At the time of his
first appearance in the world I was old enough to
regard the news of his arrival as an indiscretion
on the part of my parents. My father was a
younger son of our old and once-distinguished
Irish family. He was one of those soldiers who
are always doing the hard rough work of the Empire
and seeing the other men in the comfortable positions
getting the “Honours and Rewards.” I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[13]</span>
was born in India, and thanks to my mother’s
moderate fortune had been sent home in childhood
to receive an expensive and perfectly respectable
education.</p>

<p>At the time of Edmund’s birth my father was
at home, railing at the Indian Government and
the War Office, earning, I fear, the reputation
of a bore with a grievance in the Service Clubs,
and certainly blasting any prospects of a further
career he might have had, by his frank and perfectly
just criticism of important persons.</p>

<p>I was at Wellington, destined for Sandhurst
and the Army, for in spite of my father’s atrocious
experiences it never occurred to either of us that
the world held any other career for me.</p>

<p>Looking back I don’t think I really had any
desire to be a soldier or knew at all what was implied
in it. It just seemed inevitable, and I suppose
I had up to then as much part in shaping my
destinies as most people. I suppose that is how
the ranks of the pawn-broking, cheese-mongering,
grave-digging, and other apparently undesirable
callings are kept filled.</p>

<p>But I knew enough to resent quite definitely
the halving of my patrimony with this younger
brother, concerning whose intrusion I had been in
no way consulted.</p>

<p>I bitterly resented also the continued illness
of my mother after this event.</p>

<p>During the greater part of my short life, which
then seemed so long, she had been but a memory
of infancy, repainted during one long summer
when she had been home, and then her gracious,
lovely presence had utterly outshone even the ideal
of memory.</p>

<p>I had for her a boy’s romantic devotion, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[14]</span>
her death when the child was a year old and I
almost a man, overwhelmed me with the force
of a man’s passionate grief abrading the exquisitely
tender sensorium of a child.</p>

<p>And then the baby Edmund began to grow
like her. From the first his eyes and mouth were
hers. As he learned to speak he spoke with her
voice, and innumerable little gestures reminded
me of her. This was my first solace; and my
early, selfish, boyish resentment died down and
warmed into something else, transmuted by grief
into the second great attachment of my adolescence.</p>

<p>Nothing could quite kill this, and I suppose
that is why, at forty-five, I ordered the champagne
for him.</p>

<p>Edmund was of course intended for the Navy,
and as he grew older it seemed as if this were Nature’s
arrangement as well as the family’s. There was
no mere acquiescence in this case, as in mine.</p>

<p>But all these family dispositions were shattered
just about the time I should have entered Sandhurst.</p>

<p>The whole of my mother’s property consisted
of her interest in certain estates in the Straits
Settlements, and by some mysterious fluctuation
of trade these suddenly became almost valueless.
Relying on the stability of this property my father
had invested the whole of his patrimony in an
annuity, so that the family might live with more
dignity during his and her lifetime.</p>

<p>With this we still could make ends meet, and
even overlap, while he lived. But at his death
there would be only a pittance for Edmund and
myself. It would be utterly impossible for either of
us to maintain the family tradition in the Services.</p>

<p>For a youth in my position it was considered<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[15]</span>
that there was only one respectable alternative—the
Church.</p>

<p>It was agreed by everyone, including myself,
that I had not sufficient brains for the Bar. We
were that simple kind of folk that really believe
that a high order of intellect is necessary for success
at the Bar. I am told that this carefully fostered
superstition is not yet quite dead. I was accordingly
entered at one of the less expensive colleges
at Oxford, where I followed all the fashions, social,
mental and moral; acquired the usual affectations;
had my mind rendered as far as possible inaccessible
to ideas; and otherwise enjoyed the advantages
of what is called a “University Education.”</p>

<p>It was the fashion then for superior persons to
be patronisingly enthusiastic about what they
called the “Working Man.” I accordingly obtained
a curacy in an extremely unpleasant industrial
district, and entered Holy Orders without so
much as suspecting that I had a mind or a character
of my own.</p>

<p>From the “Working Man” I learned a little
about the technique of pigeon flying and breeding.
This information has been invaluable to me ever
since. It has provided me with one of the principal
interests in my life, and even a little very precious
distinction, when one of my birds came home
fourth in a great cross-channel event. I also
learned that the “Working Man” has no use
whatever for gentlemanly young curates from
Oxford, or their quaint little fistful of prejudices.
I had the good sense to get out of his way as soon
as I could and begin my education.</p>

<p>In the meantime Edmund had developed on
rather startling lines. Two preparatory schools
had refused to keep him after a single term. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[16]</span>
first on the grounds that he had “corrupted the
entire establishment,” the second because he was
“destitute of the moral faculty.” My father said
the case was much more serious, that “he had not
the instincts of a gentleman.”</p>

<p>My father thrashed him well and hard. When
this was over Edmund said, “I’m afraid, daddy,
this hurts you much more than it does me.”</p>

<p>Then my father consulted a doctor who said
that “a certain insensibility to pain was a frequent
accompaniment of the criminal diathesis.” He
recommended a low diet and bromides. Edmund
promptly broke out in spots. Thus he got his
way, which was to enter the mercantile marine,
as the Navy was debarred by circumstance.</p>

<p>This was grievous to my father’s old-fashioned
prejudices, but anything was better than living
with an insoluble problem with whom everyone
fell in love.</p>

<p>The reports received from the training ship
went far to reconcile him. These invariably
described Edmund as “obedient and keen.”</p>

<p>I am always glad to reflect that my poor father’s
anxiety and perplexity about this well-beloved
child were thus allayed before he very unexpectedly
died, and Edmund and I were left alone as regards
relatives.</p>

<p>For of our cousins of the senior branch in Ireland
we knew hardly anything. They wrote kindly
and respectfully about my father, but did not offer
to come to the funeral.</p>

<p>Shortly after this Edmund went to sea as a
gentleman apprentice. He was away some five
months and returned “in irons.” I learned that
he had broached cargo in order to obtain extra
rum for his mess. He explained to me that “everybody<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[17]</span>
was in it, and a fellow couldn’t stand out.
I should have been horribly ragged if I had, and
it would have been a damned unsporting thing
to do. We drew lots for who was to get the stuff,
and of course it fell to me. Just the damned
family luck. I didn’t want the beastly stuff
myself, for the simple reason that I don’t drink
rum—anything else you like, but not rum. It
makes your breath smell beastly.”</p>

<p>I was convinced that his tale was true and felt
that on the whole he had behaved well.</p>

<p>Of course one could not expect the magistrate
to take the same view. This old gentleman enjoyed
himself tremendously with such an unusual text
to preach about. However, when he had worked
off the last of his platitudes, he announced that
he had decided to give Edmund the benefit of
the First Offender’s Act. He said he was influenced
largely by the fact of the punishment already
undergone by the prisoner through his having
come home “in irons.” I believe the poor old
thing imagined that this expression involved actual
fetters.</p>

<p>As a matter of fact Edmund’s colleagues and
the cook had combined to ensure his having a
fairly comfortable time. He said himself “they
didn’t even get ratty about my having no work.”</p>

<p>So Edmund left the Court not without a stain
on his character, and saddled with certain responsibilities
as to reporting to the police which he described
in terms so blasphemous that even to hear him
made me feel unfrocked, like Stevenson’s maiden
lady when she overheard the Jongleurs’ repartee.</p>

<p>Of course Edmund’s indentures were cancelled,
and the problem of his future became to me a
very anxious one.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[18]</span>It did not at all worry Edmund. He regarded
the world as his oyster.</p>

<p>Shortly before this catastrophe I had been
presented to a small “living” in Warwickshire
by one of our distant and grandiose relatives
who had the iniquitous right of advowson. I
took Edmund down there in order that we might
“discuss the situation.”</p>

<p>My parlour-maid at once fell in love with him,
and he trod on one of the best pigeons in my modest
loft.</p>

<p>I pointed out that our joint income, including
my stipend, was likely to be less than £400 a year.</p>

<p>Edmund said that seemed a good lot for two
unmarried blokes.</p>

<p>As his own share was less than £50, I thought
this was cool.</p>

<p>“But you can’t stop on here indefinitely doing
nothing.”</p>

<p>“No,” he agreed, “not indefinitely. I think
there’s just time for a cigarette before dinner.”</p>

<p>It was impossible to get him to talk seriously
about the future. When I tried I was always whirled
away on the wings of his stories of places he had
seen and men he had met. He talked so vividly
and had so fully the artist trick of setting a character
before one, in the round and alive in a sentence,
that I once suggested writing as a possible career.
His whole being radiated scorn.</p>

<p>“Quill-driving be damned,” he said. “Even
if I knew how to do it, I’m not the sort of man.
I’m the sort of man, at least I shall lead the sort
of life, for other people to write about.”</p>

<p>I was actually, without consulting him, humbling
myself to try a jerk at the strings of the “Family
Influence” on his behalf, when he disappeared.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[19]</span>After three days he wrote:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“<span class="smcap">Dear Old Man</span>,—I’m back to the sea, so
no need to worry. I’ve got just the chance I
wanted, a first-rate sailing-ship wanting another
deck-hand. I made a lucky purchase of a very
drunken old sailor-man’s papers. No questions
were asked as they were short of hands, and I soon
convinced them I knew my job. Naturally I
have dropped the family name <i>pro tem.</i> and won’t
be sporting our coat-of-arms at present. I’ve
sent a line to Scotland Yard to tell them I’ve got
a nice opening in the haberdashery line in the
Midlands, and so won’t be looking them up
for a bit. I’ll send you a name and address to
write to as soon as there is any chance of knowing
a port of call in advance. Tell Louisa not to
fret too much, and I’ll try to bring you home
a nice parrot instead of the pigeon I damaged.
This time I’m going to be a real good, sensible boy,
and get on and all the rest of it. Honestly, dry
land seems to burn the soles of my feet after a
few days.</p>

<p>“Very many thanks to you for all you’ve done.
This is bound to be a long trip, and though I mayn’t
see you again for a year or two, you may be sure
of my real honest love. I shall make a bee line
for your place whenever I do come home.”</p>
</div>

<p>This parting was a wrench to me, and my home
seemed very dull and miserable for a time. I
had had my second sentimental tragedy, for I
had loved, and for a short time had been happy
in my love. It had all ended in disillusion and
suffering for me, and again Edmund had been my
solace. Until he had gone I did not know how
much I was dependent on him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[20]</span>Nevertheless I had again the feeling that he
had behaved well. The incident of the papers
purchased from the drunken sailor troubled my
conscience a little, but I really scarcely knew what
was involved in this, or to what extent it might
have been a fair bargain. I trusted Edmund
not to have done anything mean, and his sailing
under a false name was to me nothing but the
breach of a social convention. I had come to
look upon most conventions as things made for
the guidance of fools, to be disregarded by sensible
men as soon as they became inconvenient.</p>

<p>I know it may be argued that this theory of mine
is exactly that of the criminal. It is; but the
criminal is only a fool with some independence
of judgment—an exception.</p>

<p>The majority of fools walk between the clipped
hedges. The wise minority wanders in safety
and at large, being careful that the fools do not
witness their excursions. We have our own boundaries
which we do not transgress.</p>

<p>In the meantime the deaths of two of our Irish
cousins from diphtheria had placed me quite
near succession to the entailed portion of the family
estate, but the present incumbent being a young
vigorous man about to marry an heiress, I had
never regarded the possibility of my inheriting.</p>

<p>It was only a few months after Edmund’s departure
that this youth went fishing in waders when
he should have been in bed, and died very suddenly
of appendicitis. I was amazed and rather horrified
to find myself an Irish landlord.</p>

<p>I resigned my living and went over to Ireland,
but neither the place nor the prospect of that life
attracted me. I did not understand it, and felt
a stranger and usurper. Everything was in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[21]</span>
hands of a most capable firm of land-agents in
Dublin.</p>

<p>There was a revenue that to me represented
great wealth.</p>

<p>The place, though very large, could easily be
let for the fishing and shooting. I deliberately
ran away, and became that accursed thing—an
absentee landlord. I salved my conscience by
insisting on a policy of foolish generosity to my
tenants and found myself equally abused by the
Press of all parties in Ireland.</p>

<p>After some rather distracted wanderings I settled
down in the Sussex vicarage in which this chapter
opens. My researches in Byzantine history which
shared my energies with pigeon flying had attracted
a little attention from some of the learned, and
thus I had met the Bishop at the Athenæum.
He was patron of my present living, and as no
clergyman in his diocese could afford the upkeep
of the large and beautiful vicarage to which a
stipend of £200 a year was attached, he gladly
offered it to me and I as gladly accepted it.</p>

<p>I had no qualms of conscience, since I was going
to give the Church more than I received from
her in the way of money; I liked the work of
a country parson, and believed I could be helpful
to a few fellow human beings. As to doctrine,
that came within my category of conventions.
I had acted in good faith at the time I took my
ordination vows, and if I thought I had grown
wiser since, there was no need to make a fuss
about it. I wanted no one to believe or disbelieve
as I did, but I did want to encourage people to
behave well. I had many of my father’s old-fashioned
prejudices, and honestly believed it to
be a good thing that the Church as well as the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[22]</span>
Army should be officered as far as possible by
gentlemen.</p>

<p>Thus the years passed very placidly for me.
I and my house were in the capable charge of
Bates and Mrs. Rattray, my housekeeper and
cook, one of the best and wisest women I have
ever met. Other servants came and went at her
discretion, but my household affairs seemed always
to run on ball-bearings, and Bates tempered for
me the tyranny of the gardener and the coachman.</p>

<p>I acquired four different reputations.</p>

<p>As the breeder of “Amaryllis” who came home
fourth in the great cross-channel race already
mentioned, my name was familiar in every colliery
and public-house in the north of England.</p>

<p>Among a select circle of the learned I was known
as a conscientious and critical student of an obscure
period of history.</p>

<p>In my parish I was generally esteemed as a
kindly and generous priest and friend.</p>

<p>But by my clerical colleagues I was distrusted.
If I was only suspected of heresy, I was positively
known to be a trimmer in the vital matter of Eastward
Position! When I officiated in other people’s
churches I always adopted the position and methods
to which the congregation were accustomed. Thus
both parties united in calling me “Mr. Facing-both-ways,”
and a certain very earnest Evangelical
once said quite rude things about “Laodiceans.”</p>

<p>This buzzing in my ears was almost my only
worry, as Edmund was my only anxiety.</p>

<p>His first ship was burned in the Canton River,
and he was landed penniless. He got a cable sent
to me by the British Consul. Instead of sending
what he asked for I cabled £250 and an urgent
message to return.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[23]</span>I waited in vain for his arrival, eager to share
with him all the comfort that had come into my
life. Instead I got a letter in reply to one I had
written on chance of his start being delayed. He
congratulated me on my good fortune: had gone
up country and invested two hundred of my good
pounds in some wild-goose land speculation. All
that was wanted to make the money bring forth
an hundredfold was another thousand.</p>

<p>It was curious to me that I resented the loss
of this £250 much more than I should have done
when I was a poor man. I knew that this was
the effect of possessing money on ordinary men,
but I suppose no man expects to find himself
reacting after the manner of his kind.</p>

<p>I was angry and sent another £50 and a peremptory
message. Then I was sorry. I could see
Edmund cashing the draft and shying from the
insult like a young horse from the unexpected.
I would have given the thousand to have him back.</p>

<p>But would not the thousand have kept him there
until he lost it in its turn?</p>

<p>I heard no more and settled back as comfortably
as possible into my groove. But for the first
time I felt Edmund had not behaved well, a film
formed on the surface of my warm love for him,
and I knew there was anger towards myself in
his heart.</p>

<p>Nearly two years passed during which he wrote
three times when he wanted money—paltry sums
which I loathed sending, but I could not trust
him with a larger amount, though God knows
I was willing to share my all with him, if he would
only spend it and live on it.</p>

<p>Then he had come, announced by wire from
Southampton.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[24]</span>He came in his fo’c’sle kit, with three sovereigns
and some shillings which he called his “savings.”
But he brought the promised parrot in a gilded
cage, and a costly offering of Chinese silk for Louisa,
who had long ago vanished into the limbo which
awaits parlour vestals disapproved of by Mrs.
Rattray.</p>

<p>I admit I was a little nervous about the effect
of his arrival and appearance on the arbiters of
my household, but in twenty-four hours they were
all his slaves. He talked to Bates as to a fellow
man without any spurious bridging of the fixed
gulf, and presented him with a strange exotic
pipe. The Chinese silks destined for Louisa he
gave to Mrs. Rattray, and I overheard him telling
the entranced lady that he had brought them
home for her in gratitude for her care of myself,
about which he said I wrote so constantly. Thus
I was made as it were accessory to his falsehoods
and a partaker in the benefit of them.</p>

<p>Most amazing of all I found him plucking fruit
I would not have dared to touch while he told
sea-tales to the completely subjugated gardener.</p>

<p>To me he was delightful as ever. There was
all his boyish affection, but that film was there,
and I was aware of the spell he exercised as something
to be resisted in his own interest. We never
spoke of my refusal to send the thousand, but the
memory of it was there between us.</p>

<p>He was then only twenty-three, but his aspect
and manner of a fully equipped man of the world,
of vigour and competence to subdue circumstances
to his will, made him seem older. It justified a
certain humorous treatment of myself as a kind
of “dear old thing.” I had to brace myself to
keep my head.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[25]</span>It was not until the third evening that I fairly
got the talk on to his own affairs and prospects.</p>

<p>I unfolded a scheme I had for settling him in
the family estate as my representative. I explained
my own coward flight and my desire, that notwithstanding
that, the name should not lapse.</p>

<p>“In any case,” I argued, “your son, if you ever
have one, will inherit. I shall not marry.”</p>

<p>“Everybody thinks that,” he objected.</p>

<p>“We won’t discuss it,” I said, “but in my case
there are reasons why you may take it as definite.”</p>

<p>He looked up and saw at once that this was
final.</p>

<p>“I’m sorry,” he said, “very sorry, old man.
But even for the sake of a possible Davoren of
the next generation, I can’t accept your offer.”</p>

<p>“Why?”</p>

<p>“To begin with it’s too generous.”</p>

<p>“It’s my desire—for my own sake.”</p>

<p>“In any case I’m not the man for the job. I
couldn’t do it any more than you could yourself.
Fancy me a country gentleman! M.F.H. I suppose,
and I can’t even ride! I should start comic and
become pathetic. I’m only a sort of ticket o’
leave man still, and they’d want to make me a
magistrate!”</p>

<p>I disagreed with him, but saw that argument
was useless and abandoned this favourite project
with regret.</p>

<p>“Have you any plan yourself?” I asked.</p>

<p>“Well, you see, it’s the old story. Dry land
burns my feet.”</p>

<p>“But you can’t go on always—before the mast.”</p>

<p>“No. I can take my master’s certificate.”</p>

<p>This sounded pleasantly practical to me, and
I was surprised and gratified to learn that he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[26]</span>
had mastered the theoretical side of navigation
and could, as he said, “pass the old Board of
Trade exams, with one hand tied behind him.”</p>

<p>I encouraged the notion and told him I had
no doubt of getting the old trouble with the police
cancelled by some of my influential friends on the
grounds of lapse of time, youthful indiscretion and
subsequent good behaviour.</p>

<p>He laughed at the last clause in a way that
made me anxious.</p>

<p>“Well,” he said, “they know nothing about
me over here.”</p>

<p>“Then you can go to sea in your own name
and in a decent capacity.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” he drawled satirically, “as Third Officer
on a P. &amp; O. I suppose, showing ladies round the
ship, putting on a boiled shirt and company manners
for dinner. No. I’m afraid I should be no better
at that than the squire business.”</p>

<p>“But there must be a start of some sort.”</p>

<p>“Not that sort. You people who stop at home
see life as if it was half a dozen sets of railway
lines, and a man must run on one or the other.
It isn’t like that at all. If a man just dives in
as he would into the sea, he can swim, he can
live. There’s always something to eat. Making
money is only the stake on the game, but the game
is played for its own sake. All the duffers are
losers, and if you’re not a duffer you win. Then
you can come out of it and be as respectable as
you like. You will at least have your own memories
to live on.”</p>

<p>“It’s a bit vague,” I said, deliberately unmoved
by his eloquence.</p>

<p>“To be precise, then, my game is going to be
trade. When I’ve got my master’s certificate<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[27]</span>
I mean to be master and part owner of a little
trading brigantine out East. I’ve studied the
thing and I know the business. It’s the life I
like and understand, and there’s pots of money
in it when you know the ropes, and the right people.
I’m not talking any story-book rot. There are
commodities out there that you can trade best
in in small boats. Little cargoes of high value.
Things people know nothing about at home.”</p>

<p>“It all means capital, doesn’t it?”</p>

<p>“Oh, of course one must have some capital,
very little to start. To people in the know it’s a
first-rate investment.”</p>

<p>I said no more, and Edmund knew I meant to
refuse to find the money for him. I can understand
better now how exasperating I must have seemed.
A country parson wrapping himself in a cloak of
ignorance and taking it for superior wisdom!</p>

<p>However, he kept his temper perfectly, but this
little root of bitterness between us grew and swelled.</p>

<p>He stopped with me during the weeks it took to
obtain his certificate and satisfy the legal authorities
of his having purged his early offence. Then he
signed on as second officer on board an East-bound
tramp. Beyond his necessary expenses and £50,
for which he insisted on giving me an IOU, he would
take nothing from me.</p>

<p>I know nothing of his Odyssey during the next
two years, except that he told me that through
friends in Hong-Kong he had secured a small
interest in a trading venture and had both made
and lost money. But he came home as poor
as he went, though fuller than ever of confidence.
As gay hearted at twenty-five as he had been at
eighteen and delightful as ever to look upon.</p>

<p>I had good news for him. During his absence<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[28]</span>
there had been an opportunity of realising the
remnant of my mother’s estate, and acting under
a Power of Attorney I had from him I had sold
out on his behalf as well as my own.</p>

<p>There was thus a sum of nearly £2,000 awaiting
Edmund. Had I known why the property came
to have a value at all, and held on until the “Rubber
Boom” developed, it would have been nearer
£10,000. As it was, others made this money.
But to do Edmund justice, he never reproached me
with this.</p>

<p>He went back to the East with his fortune, his
high spirits, and his confidence.</p>

<p>He wrote twice at long intervals, each time
wanting money. He explained that this was for
necessary current expenses, not for speculation;
that his capital was practically intact but locked
up in trade. Freights and markets had gone
against him every time, but it was only a matter
of holding on. He was bound to win out all right.</p>

<p>I seemed to see a wistful eye and a trembling
lip in the letters, and I hated the thought of Edmund
beaten. I think I wanted him to prove me wrong
to myself. And yet the sending of the money was
oddly annoying, though I neither missed it nor
grudged it. It somehow thickened that film on
our affections.</p>

<p>Thus as I have said for over a year I had heard
nothing until this telegram arrived.</p>

<p>I trust I have explained my reluctance to order
the champagne, and my final capitulation to Bates’s
reproachful eye.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER II<br>

<small>THE BRANDY HOLE</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">EDMUND’S appearance on arrival was a surprise.</p>

<p>Instead of the fo’c’sle kit, or the uniform
of a needy officer of the mercantile marine, which
had disfigured his previous appearances, he came
arrayed in blue serge. He wore a suit designed
by a tailor with a soul for his art, somehow suggesting
an association with the sea in lines that
everywhere emphasised the grace and strength of
his figure, while conforming to the strictest tradition
of Savile Row. Everything about him was
in keeping. His luggage, that great index of a
man’s prosperity, was of the solidest and richest
leather, not too new, and with the exquisite surface
and the rich tone that leather acquires under
the hands of a first-rate servant.</p>

<p>I had never seen Edmund like this. His air of
distinction disconcerted me. It made me proud
of him, but shy also. This was such a new, strange
Edmund. And yet just the same in his warm
affection.</p>

<p>His presence blew away all the mists of distrust
and resentment as though they were a miasma of
my own creation, the remembrance of which shamed
me to a feeling of meanness. I felt paltry in my own
eyes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[30]</span>I remembered what he had said of life, and felt
myself an empty wagon on a side-track.</p>

<p>A queer shudder of apprehension went down
my spine at the thought that he had but to couple
me to his motive force and I would be a helpless
thing to be dragged behind him.</p>

<p>Then I bethought me I had got the metaphor
wrong. I would be on a track no longer, but in
tow to him on the high seas of life—a thing terrifying
to a middle-aged parson who had long ago
found a backwater and bobbed at anchor in it.
All these ideas, unformulated, passed through my
mind in the fuss of his arrival and our greetings.</p>

<p>At dinner he made merry over the pretentiousness
of the wine.</p>

<p>“Confess, now, you would not have had champagne
up for a poor devil of a deck-hand!”</p>

<p>“I wouldn’t have had it in any case. It was
Bates insisted.”</p>

<p>“Pardon me, sir,” said Bates.</p>

<p>Bates had so got into the habit of talking to
me during my usual solitary meals, that he committed
the unpardonable indiscretion in a servant
of having ears and a voice. It was plain he did not
regard Edmund as “company.”</p>

<p>“Well you didn’t actually say anything,” I
admitted in justice to him.</p>

<p>Edmund laughed, evidently a little triumphant
at the devotion of Bates. He insisted on his
bringing another glass and pledging him.</p>

<p>Informal as the occasion was, Bates was a little
self-conscious at this.</p>

<p>“My best respects, sir,” he said as he lifted the
glass.</p>

<p>I watched Edmund, wondering what was the new
expression in his face that somehow dissatisfied me.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[31]</span>His experiences, whatever they were, had made
little change in him. His charm was undiminished,
perhaps increased. But there was some change that
would have eluded anyone less intimate than myself.</p>

<p>“A portrait painter would catch it,” I thought,
seeking for the word to clarify my impression.</p>

<p>As he nodded over his glass to Bates, it came to
me.</p>

<p>“Surrender!” I almost spoke it.</p>

<p>What could he have surrendered? Something
that had been precious I was certain.</p>

<p>All our talk was of trivial things at home as though
by mutual avoidance of any discussion of his
adventures; we were dominated by the fencing
shyness that comes over men, however intimate,
when a discussion of importance is inevitable between
them.</p>

<p>There was a silence as we tasted the first glass
of the precious port, I wondering if he would say
that it had passed its prime.</p>

<p>Then, as though from beneath the table, came
a sound, to me familiar and somehow pleasant in
its way, but puzzling, even disconcerting to strangers:
the distant, muffled ring of iron upon iron. It was
the unmistakable thud of a blacksmith’s hammer
on soft red iron followed by the clear taps on the
cold resonant anvil, repeated in regular rhythm.</p>

<p>“What the deuce is that?” asked Edmund,
listening.</p>

<p>“They’re working late at the smithy.”</p>

<p>“Is there a new smithy?”</p>

<p>“As a matter of fact it’s a very old one. But,
of course, it was closed when you were here before.
It’s been going about a year now. I’ve got quite
accustomed to the sound. In fact it’s company
sometimes.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[32]</span>“But the old smithy was right down near the
beach?”</p>

<p>“It’s there still, but it’s not 400 yards in a straight
line from here. Our hearing the sound is because
it is built over an old passage or tunnel which used
to open into the cellar under this room. It is said
to connect with an opening in the cliff over the beach.
It’s a relic of the old smuggling days. We are
rather proud of it.”</p>

<p>“I should say it looks a bit fishy for some of your
reverend predecessors.”</p>

<p>“Fortunately for the credit of the Church this
was not always the vicarage. I believe it was the
Dower-house of the Manor, and very likely some
dear old dowagers eked out their jointures by a
little ‘free-trading.’ Shall we have coffee in the
study?”</p>

<p>“Wait a bit,” said Edmund, “I’m rather fascinated
by this noise. I suppose you have explored
the passage?”</p>

<p>“No. I’ve opened the old door in the cellar
and gone down the steps leading into it. But I
hate underground places. I fear I suffer from
what the doctors call claustro-phobia.”</p>

<p>“Is that cob-webs?”</p>

<p>“Well, mental cob-webs I suppose! Anyhow,
smugglers’ passages are a bit out of my line. But
I have found the opening in the cliff, at least I
think so. It’s cunningly hidden from the front
by a mass of chalk. I was led to it by what I
suppose was the smugglers’ old track. One of my
birds landed exhausted on the cliff after a cross-channel
flight, and I had to rescue him.”</p>

<p>“Well, I should have been right down that passage
and out at the other end if I’d been you. Any
objection to my exploring it to-morrow with Bates?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[33]</span>“None whatever, so long as you bring Bates
back undamaged.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Bates!” he said laughing, “It doesn’t
matter about me.”</p>

<p>“Not so much, old man. You’ve made me get
used to doing without you. But without Bates I
should be as a pelican in the wilderness. Come on,
if you’ve finished your wine, for I must hear your
story, and what you have been doing.”</p>

<p>My diary contains a very complete record of my
talk with Edmund on this occasion, and looking
back it seems to me that he paid me a great compliment.
I see now how perfectly sincere he was.
Then I was too absorbed in trifles and pettifogging
distrusts to rejoice in what he said at all. I had
to precipitate the conversation, and I did it bluntly
by asking him why he had left me so long without
a letter.</p>

<p>“Don’t you understand,” he asked me, “that I
have come to look on you as the ‘friend born for
adversity’?”</p>

<p>I told him I didn’t quite follow.</p>

<p>He said, “It’s hard to explain. Potty little
things like money come into it so much. But
every time I’ve written to you I’ve been in trouble
of some sort. You’ve never given me advice.
If it’s only been money, you’ve always forked out.
But the point is, you’ve always been there—just
yourself—someone to be responsible to. Damn it,
I can’t explain. But it’s kept me—well—no—I
can’t say straight, exactly, but reasonably decent.
So that I <i>could</i> come back and shake your hand,
anyhow.”</p>

<p>“And you have prospered, after all?”</p>

<p>“Well, I didn’t lose everything, but darned
nearly. You were right not to trust me about<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[34]</span>
that Far Eastern Trade. I was very young and
very cock-sure, and it was some time before I discovered
there were too many sharks in those
waters. Lord, what a young ass I was! Those
Hong-Kong fellows had me weighed up to an ounce.
I had a bad time kicking myself, but I managed
to pull out my last £200. That annoyed them
desperately. I got a little of my own back in some
other ways too. But I don’t think you’d like that
story. It was then I met Welfare.”</p>

<p>“Welfare? Who’s he? It’s rather a jolly
name.”</p>

<p>“Yes. The name influenced me. He’s my partner.
Captain Welfare he calls himself. You must
meet him.”</p>

<p>I saw the look I didn’t quite understand become
accentuated in Edmund’s face.</p>

<p>“I didn’t know you had a partner. Partner in
what? What is your business? Let’s have the
tale from the beginning.”</p>

<p>“It’s too long. We’re in the Levant fruit trade.
Welfare’s a rum old chap. The sort one simply
can’t explain to people at home. He’s always
knocked about, mostly at sea. Calls himself Captain,
but I don’t believe he’s ever commanded anything.
He knows damn-all about navigation; but
he can handle a ship all right.</p>

<p>“He’s admitted having been a steward on a
liner. He got his start by collecting paper money
from passengers—changing it, you know. Always
getting hold of paper at a discount and unloading
it at some port where it was up a few points. It’s
extraordinary how paper money values fluctuate
with latitude. Welfare had the whole thing worked
out so that he was on velvet every time. As he
says, it’s a nice safe line, but dull. And he didn’t<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[35]</span>
like being a steward. The old boy has got his pride,
and the tips went against the grain, I fancy. He
was in the Pacific for a time and did pretty well
with copra.</p>

<p>“Then he thought he was man enough for the
Eastern coasting business. When I met him he
had just been stung by some merchants in Shanghai.
He was taking it badly—oh, rottenly! I found
him in an opium shebeen and broke his collar
bone getting him on a rickshaw. I got hold of a
decent European doctor man. Old Welfare carried
on frightfully about his collar bone while he
was crazy, but the little doctor got him round all
right. He used to come and stick a needle into
him and squirt stuff into him—atropine and
all sorts of poisons. Old Crippen’s stuff he told
me he used when Welfare was rowdy. Anyhow,
Welfare got all right, only beastly sentimental.”</p>

<p>Edmund paused to light another cigar, and I
did not interrupt him. I find it is impossible in
writing to convey any idea of the casual way in
which his narrative dribbled out.</p>

<p>Only that morning one of my old ladies in the
parish had been much more impressive about the
quality of some dried peas she had bought from our
local grocer—a relentless monopolist, but a sidesman
and communicant.</p>

<p>To her I knew exactly what to say, how to
sympathise. But Edmund made me feel as if I
had swallowed a bound volume of <i>The Boy’s Own
Paper</i>.</p>

<p>I waited until his cigar was fairly under way.</p>

<p>“You have not yet told me what you are doing
now,” I said.</p>

<p>“No. I must come to that. We’re all right now.
Certainly I did old Welfare a good turn, but he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[36]</span>
has more than repaid it. We had both been
stung, but we found we could put up about £500
between us. He said he had always kept this
Levant business up his sleeve, and it was absolutely
‘It’ for people with a small capital, like
us. He had a pal, a Dutchman, who kept a hotel in
Alexandria. Well, we went down there. The Dutchman
was all right but very cautious. Things
hung fire a bit. I had to keep myself and I didn’t
want to touch my capital. There wasn’t much left
to touch. Well, the fact is I ‘managed’ a steam
laundry there for three months. Made it pay, too.”</p>

<p>“That’s good,” I said.</p>

<p>“Yes—you should have seen the steam! and the
natives blowing water from their mouths on the stuff
while it was ironed! Nice clean women’s frocks!
I couldn’t stick it.”</p>

<p>“It sounds very unpleasant.”</p>

<p>“Oh, it was rotten! Summer weather too.
However, the luck turned then and we bought
the <i>Astarte</i> with the help of the Dutchman. We’ve
paid him off now and she’s all our own.”</p>

<p>“And what on earth is the <i>Astarte</i>?” I asked.</p>

<p>“I thought I had told you. She’s our boat of
course. A rum-looking thing in these waters.
But just what I’ve always dreamed of. I am
master and part owner, and I told you years ago
that was what I was setting out to be; only I
didn’t think it would be in the Mediterranean.”</p>

<p>There was a long pause in our talk, I looking at
Edmund, thinking of him as he should have been,
rising from step to step in the Navy, carrying on the
old family tradition of service and duty.</p>

<p>I could not help noticing a restraint in his manner,
as though he were making careful selection of the
parts of his story he chose to tell me. And there<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[37]</span>
was that look on his face, the look of surrender, a
subtle weakening about the mouth and chin; and
in his eyes, I fancied, the mere shrewdness of the
merchant elbowing out the look of command that
had been natural to him.</p>

<p>“Tell me about the <i>Astarte</i> and the trade,” I said.</p>

<p>“Ah, the little <i>Astarte</i> is the best part of the
story,” said Edmund with a return of enthusiasm.
“We got her for an old song and we’ve made a
dandy ship of her. She’s a Levantine schooner,
Greek really, about 150 tons. Wood, of course, but
we have a good new copper bottom on her. She’s
a bit slow, but stiff as a poker in a breeze, and
comfortable as a country pub! And she’ll point
as near the wind as anything I ever sailed. Rum-looking
though, when you’re not used to the type.
Any amount of free-board sloping up to long high
bows and an enormous jib-boom. She carries a
flight of head-sails like a skein of geese. She has
two big leg-o’-mutton sails, and we can shove a
couple of square sails on the foremast when we want
to. Oh, she’s pretty, I can tell you, and head-room
enough for a giraffe in the saloon. You must
come for a cruise in her.”</p>

<p>“I’d love to. Where is she now?”</p>

<p>“She’s in Tilbury at present. Old Welfare’s
there with her on some business. He looks after
the trade mostly. I do the yachting. I tell you,
it’s just owning a yacht that keeps herself and her
owners too!”</p>

<p>“And how do you make all the money?”</p>

<p>“Well—mostly fruit. Welfare’s great idea was
trading direct with the Arabs on the Egypt and
Palestine coast. In the season we load up their
dates and figs and melons, and take them and sell
almost direct to the consumers. So we are our own<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[38]</span>
middle-men and collar all the profits. Then
there are lots of odds and ends in the East. Curios
and cheap fabrics, brass ware, Gaza pottery, jewellery.
No end of things that would sell like hot
cakes in this country. We have collected stacks of
things. In fact that’s partly what brought us home.
And what I’m afraid you won’t like is that, following
up our direct trading principles, we’re going
to run a shop of our own. Like those places in
Port Said, you know. If you saw the prices those
fellows get!”</p>

<p>“But why on earth shouldn’t I like it? Especially
if it brings you home oftener. Why, my
dear fellow, shop-keeping is rapidly passing into
the hands of the aristocracy while the bourgeoisie
buy up the old estates!”</p>

<p>I was greatly relieved, thinking this was the secret
of his slight embarrassment and the look that had
puzzled me.</p>

<p>All his story was perfectly plausible to me.
Looking back now I do not really see that any
country parson, ignorant alike of commerce and of
the near East, could be blamed for finding nothing
suspicious in it.</p>

<p>“Then you wouldn’t mind our business being
in Brighton?” he asked. “It’s a bit near you.
But of course our name won’t be over the window.
No need for anyone to know you’ve any association
with it at all. Welfare wants to call it ‘Oriental
Bazaar’ or some old stale thing like that. He
was wild with me for suggesting ‘Fakes Limited.’
One reason he wants Brighton is because the
<i>Astarte</i> could stand in near enough to be seen from
the front and send in boat-loads of stuff under the
eyes of the populace. Then it’s handy for London,
and of course the real trade must go through<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[39]</span>
London. But of course the main reason for striking
Brighton is that its season is all the year round.
It’s always full of people with more money than
brains.”</p>

<p>“I think it’s a splendid idea,” I said, and I really
meant it. “Everything you sell, whatever its
price, will be the genuine thing—straight from the
East. We associate shop-keeping with the huckstering
ideas of a servile class. I’ve often wanted
to prove that shop-keeping, all trade, can be ennobled.
But what can a mere shareholder do?
What does he know even of the things that are
done in his name?”</p>

<p>“Wait a minute, old man. I don’t want to give
you any impression that we’re out for the purification
of trade, or anything of the sort. We’re out
for money—and fun. At least I am. Welfare’s
out for money.”</p>

<p>“Quite,” said I, in my new-born enthusiasm.
“And it’s all the better. I don’t want any amateur
things. They’re all quack things. Edmund, I’d
like to be a partner in this. If you want capital,
you know I can find it.”</p>

<p>To my surprise Edmund looked rather distressed.</p>

<p>“It might seem cheap,” I continued, “to offer
you money now when you are prospering and
probably can get it without difficulty. I mean
after I refused to finance you before. But I’m
sure you know me better than to think it’s only
security I have in mind.”</p>

<p>“I do, old man,” said Edmund, “I know you too
well. I know you would give me all the money we
want and more. And as a financial proposition
I could honestly advise you to do it. But somehow
I don’t want you to. Money after all is a very
secondary thing—when you have got it. Welfare<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[40]</span>
can raise all we want, he says, in the city. <i>You
keep out of it.</i>”</p>

<p>“But I want to be in it! Can’t you imagine
a little craving for romance, even at my advanced
age? And the Levant! Do you know I correspond
in Latin with monasteries there? That I have
always promised myself a trip there and have
been too lazy to go? Couldn’t I go to Scutari
in the <i>Astarte</i> if I were a partner? And I have
a dear friend in Aleppo whom I have never seen.
I wonder what a monk’s Latin would sound like,
spoken? This man I believe started life as an
Albanian.”</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” said Edmund. “I never
tried talking Latin to an Albanian monk. As a
matter of fact I never got beyond ‘mensa’ myself.
I started ‘dominus’ and switched on to
the modern side, just when I arrived at the genitive
plural. Of course we could go up the Dardanelles
and you could get ashore and explore about. But
if it’s business, you must talk it over with Welfare.
He’s coming to Brighton.”</p>

<p>“Well, let’s have him here.”</p>

<p>“You could have him here if you like, of course,”
said Edmund merrily. “He won’t actually deafen
you with the crash of falling H’s, and he won’t
get puzzled among the forks on the dinner table.
But I’ve told you—he’s not what you and I call a
gentleman. And unfortunately he’s what they
call, I believe, a convinced Nonconformist.”</p>

<p>I looked at Edmund, but he was perfectly serious.</p>

<p>To me it was as though I had been told that
Odysseus had been a homœopath.</p>

<p>“If he doesn’t mind being the guest of the
Established Church I expect we’ll get on very well.
I’m not exactly bigoted on doctrinal points.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[41]</span>“No. But I’m wondering how Bates would
stick him?”</p>

<p>“Really, Edmund, I know I spoil Bates, and so
do you when you’re here, but I have not got the
length of allowing him to choose my guests.”</p>

<p>“Well, old Welfare will enjoy it. As a matter
of fact he’ll be enormously flattered. He’ll take
you for a sort of ‘swell,’ to use his own language.
And he’ll be tremendously interested in that
underground passage.”</p>

<p>“Why?” I queried, in surprise.</p>

<p>If this were a play or a novel I suppose the stage
direction would be that “Edmund bit his lip.”
Of course he didn’t do anything of the sort. I
don’t suppose any sane human being ever did,
though I have myself bitten my tongue accidentally.
I did however get an impression that Edmund
somehow felt he had committed an indiscretion,
which I suppose is what the novelists and playwrights
mean. He went on a little embarrassed.</p>

<p>“I suppose it’s a desire for romance on his part
too. He likes poking his nose into anything of
that sort. No cob-webs about him! Anyhow, I’ll
spend a good deal of to-morrow working through that
passage and find out if there’s anything to show
him. We might find hidden treasure in it—The
smugglers’ hoard! If they left any brandy there
it would be worth drinking by now.”</p>

<p>I was at a loss to understand his eagerness about
this passage, and some instinct made me resent
it a little. I put it to myself that I did not want
the peace of my home disturbed. I did not want
foul air and dust coming up into the house. I
preferred to go elsewhere for the details of romance.
I knew that these were not my real reasons.
But I had always avoided the tunnel without<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[42]</span>
knowing why, and I did not want it disturbed now.</p>

<p>“You will probably find there is no tunnel at all,”
I said. “It may be just a village tradition.”</p>

<p>“But you have seen both ends of it. And how
else could the noise come from the forge? Anyhow,
I’ll know all about it to-morrow.”</p>

<p>I brought the conversation back to the more
congenial topic of the <i>Astarte</i> and my projected
cruise.</p>

<p>I had always been a keen yachtsman, and the
novelty and the unconventional nature of the trip
appealed to me.</p>

<p>There was nothing to prevent my finding a suitable
man to take charge of the parish for a few
weeks or more. Edmund’s attitude was a little
discouraging. He was certainly not enthusiastic.</p>

<p>“We must see how you and Welfare get on,”
he said. “It’s close quarters with a man if you
don’t just hit it with him. It’s a queer ship’s
company, anyhow. All the crew are Arabs. You
see their food costs next to nothing; flour and
lentils and the milk of a couple of goats, mostly.
And they work like niggers for a couple of piastres
a day. We have a sort of skipper over them
called Jakoub, I don’t know any other name for
him. He’s a magnificent sailor-man, knows all
our boat and everybody in it. He rules his men
with—well, the Arab equivalent of a rod of iron,
acts as interpreter and saves us all bother with
natives. In fact he’s practically invaluable, and
I firmly believe, an ineffable blackguard.”</p>

<p>“He doesn’t live with you, I presume?”</p>

<p>“Good God, no! He’s a native.”</p>

<p>“It will be an education to me to meet him.”</p>

<p>“Then the Eastern end of the Mediterranean
would be too hot for you in summer, and in winter<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[43]</span>
one is liable to get a dusting in the Bay that I’m
afraid you wouldn’t enjoy; not in a little tub
like the <i>Astarte</i>.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I don’t think I’d mind that. Anyhow, I
could go overland and pick you up at Marseilles
or wherever you are calling.”</p>

<p>“Yes. You could do that. I’ll tell you what,
you’d better try a short cruise first to see how you
like it. We could have a look round the Channel
Isles. In fact we want to go to Guernsey. We’ll
talk it over with Welfare.”</p>

<p>I went to bed cherishing a hope that Edmund
might forget or abandon his proposed exploration
of the tunnel. But an inveterate ringing of the
anvil during our breakfast, and Edmund’s evident
attention to it, warned me that such hopes were vain.</p>

<p>He instructed Bates to procure a pick and shovel
and a lantern, and demanded what time he would
be at liberty to assist him in exploring.</p>

<p>“I could be finished for an hour perhaps about
ten o’clock,” said Bates, “unless Mr. Davoren
wants me for anything special.”</p>

<p>“Oh no,” I said. “I shall be busy all morning.”</p>

<p>I could see the fellow was as keen as a schoolboy
on this nonsensical burrowing, and that the
quick instinct of a servant had somehow detected
that I did not care about it. But I felt it was
better to surrender with a good grace.</p>

<p>Presently I watched the two of them disappear
down into the cellars with pick and shovel, some
gardener’s baskets, a stable lamp and an electric
torch.</p>

<p>I found a sympathiser in Mrs. Rattray.</p>

<p>“It’s likely the two of them will be suffocated
with foul air,” she said, “and Bates wanting to
take the bird-cage with the canary in it, because<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[44]</span>
he read in the papers they took them down after
explosions in the mines, when all the poor women
would be waiting on the top. ‘You’d be the easier
spared of the two,’ I told him, and the dirt they’ll
be bringing up on their feet—they’re like a pair
of children, sir.”</p>

<p>“No better indeed, Mrs. Rattray. Perhaps the
door mat from the hall?”</p>

<p>I escaped into the study, only to be driven out
by the muffled sound of blows and horrid scrapings
of the shovel. I retreated to the pigeon-loft.</p>

<p>This kind of thing went on all that day and the
next.</p>

<p>Edmund was late for all meals and brought to
them an earthy smell. Bates was never available
when I wanted him.</p>

<p>Edmund reported the passage as being evidently
of great antiquity, and quite roomy. It was
only blocked in places, he said, and they had had
no difficulty in clearing these so far.</p>

<p>“We are propping the roof where it has fallen
in or looks dicky,” he said, “otherwise we should
have been through by now. I’m sure we’ll find
the other opening all right because the air’s pretty
fresh and we’ve found a lot of bats hanging up.
You must come down to-morrow.”</p>

<p>“No thanks, the bats have decided me. There is
between them and me what Lamb calls an ‘imperfect
sympathy.’”</p>

<p>“Oh, rot! We’ll get rid of them for you.”</p>

<p>On the second afternoon they had triumphantly
emerged on the cliff over the beach. I met them
there and found the opening was the place I had
suspected. It was about four feet high and the
same width, but a great detached mass of chalk
completely hid it from below, or from the sea. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[45]</span>
rough path that led up to it seemed to have been
hewn out of the face of the cliff, but had been much
worn and weathered away so that it was quite an
awkward scramble to reach it now, and impossible
for children. This may account for the curious fact
that none of the present villagers seemed to know its
whereabouts, though there was a strong tradition
of a “brandy hole” somewhere on the beach.</p>

<p>I was tempted to penetrate a little distance into
this end of the tunnel and was surprised at its
spaciousness. A few yards from the opening one
could stand upright, and it was quite five feet in
width. Edmund said it was the same size all the
way. In places the chalk face had been plastered,
and I strongly suspected that this might be the remains
of Saxon work. It was certainly of immemorial
age, though it very probably had been adopted
and used by the smugglers. There were remains
of Saxon masonry in my church of which, as a
parish, we were very proud. And I was the more
inclined to date the digging of the passage to this
remote period because I knew of nothing in the
history of the parish in later times to account for
it. Altogether the discovery was much more
interesting than I had expected; but I refused to
face the bats, so we walked home by the village.</p>

<p>“We must report this to the Archæological
Society,” I said. “If, as I think, it proves to be
Saxon there will be great excitement over it.”</p>

<p>“Oh, hang the Archæological Society,” said
Edmund. “Let’s keep it to ourselves for a bit,
till I have finished my investigations anyhow.”</p>

<p>A sudden vision of streams of hungry and extremely
boring archæologists claiming the hospitality
of the vicarage quenched my new-born
ardour.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[46]</span>“Yes, it’s really your show,” I agreed. “You
can write a paper on it yourself in your own time.”</p>

<p>“Thanks. I think I see myself.”</p>

<p>At home Edmund found a letter from Captain
Welfare dating from the Ship Hotel at Brighton.
He had found what he thought suitable premises
for the new shop, and wanted Edmund to go over
and see them.</p>

<p>“Then you can bring him back here for as long
as he likes, and we can talk everything over,” I
said.</p>

<p>So it was settled.</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[47]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER III<br>

<small>THE BISHOP PROPOSES A TOAST</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">EDMUND had gone to Brighton to meet his
partner and inspect the “desirable premises”
for their proposed curiosity shop.</p>

<p>Captain Welfare was to return with him some time
before dinner. I had the day before me and I
awaited their coming with a great curiosity as to
the personality of this stranger. I was uneasy
too, for Edmund was so much committed to him,
and seemed to leave his destiny so much in his hands.
From all he had told me about him, Captain Welfare
did not seem to me the most desirable kind
of person to have such a responsibility. He was
certainly an adventurer, and hitherto not even a
very successful one. And he was admittedly a
man of low origin.</p>

<p>However, it was clear that Edmund was born a
bohemian and would always be one. There had
always been some such in our family, and as I
thought of what I knew of their careers I could
not deny that they seemed on the whole to have been
much more charming people and to have got much
more really out of life, than the sober average of the
rest of us.</p>

<p>I was certain that Welfare would prove to be vulgar
and could only hope he had a sense of honour.</p>

<p>Although I had carefully refrained from any<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[48]</span>
criticism, which I knew would only irritate Edmund,
I did in fact rather dislike the idea of the shop,
and though my ignorance of commercial matters
was fairly complete, it seemed to me unnecessary
and unbusinesslike to have brought the <i>Astarte</i>
all the way from the Eastern Mediterranean for
the purpose of establishing and stocking it. I
could only suppose it was a case of combining
business with pleasure.</p>

<p>I determined to put aside all these worrying
preoccupations and return to some literary work
that had been interrupted since Edmund’s return.</p>

<p>Again I was interrupted, and somewhat fluttered,
by the receipt of a telegram.</p>

<p>This was from the bishop to say he was coming
over about lunch time and would stay the night if
convenient.</p>

<p>Whatever Captain Welfare proved to be I felt
he would harmonise ill with the bishop, and my
first impulse was to reply with some honourable
fiction that would postpone the visit. But even
as I cast about in my mind for the suitable subterfuge
to commit to the pre-paid form, I bethought
me of how seldom my dear bishop got a chance of
taking refuge with me for one quiet bachelor evening,
of the disappointment it would be to both of
us to lose this one. Besides, I reflected, Parminter
is a man of the world, much more so than I am,
and he has a catholic taste in mankind. Captain
Welfare will interest him, whatever he is, and he
has always wanted to meet Edmund. Anyhow there
would be time enough to explain everything to him.</p>

<p>I wrote “Delighted” on the telegraph form and
gave it to Bates.</p>

<p>“It’s the Bishop,” I said to Bates.</p>

<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[49]</span>“He will be here for lunch and will stop the
night.”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p>“Of course his Lordship will have his usual room.
Put Captain Welfare somewhere else.”</p>

<p>“Very well, sir.”</p>

<p>Having thus made my preparations as a thoughtful
host, I found it was impossible to settle down to
my monograph on the “Greco-Turkish Alliance of
the Sixth Century.”</p>

<p>I went out and awaited the bishop amid the
sedative influences of my pigeons.</p>

<p>The Right Rev. John Parminter was not only
my diocesan, but for some years had been, and
thank God still is, my dearest friend. He shared
my interest in the Byzantine Empire, and, as I
think I have mentioned, it was this which first
brought us together.</p>

<p>As a bishop he had less spare money, and far
less leisure than I had, to devote to our common
hobby. He professed to envy me as an “authority.”
As a matter of fact I am but a painstaking
student. What my few books possess of merit
in the way of generalisation, of inference or speculation,
they owe entirely to Parminter’s inspiration.</p>

<p>He is one of those men born to distinction, who
show the fact from schoolboy days. At this time
he was in his early fifties, some eight years older
than myself, but quite among our younger bishops.
He was a young man, and indeed still is, in mind
and heart, and even in physique.</p>

<p>But he was already a power and influence in both
Church and State, and had managed to avoid
the hatred and mistrust of all parties in the Church
although he wore the label of none of them.</p>

<p>I believe I alone knew the extent of his heterodoxy.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[50]</span>
It was indeed my greatest honour to have
been chosen as his confidant.</p>

<p>Whenever it was possible, he loved to come to
my vicarage for what he called “a night’s holiday,”
and the one mystery of my household was that
the bishop kept here, and always wore, an ordinary
layman’s dinner-jacket and <i>trousers</i>!</p>

<p>“This is dreadfully short notice,” he said as I
met him at the hall-door, “but I know you would
have told me if my coming was a nuisance.”</p>

<p>“I would. If you could ever be a nuisance,
I’m the man to say it. Come along in.”</p>

<p>He could not abide any ceremony in my house,
and insisted on my calling him “Parminter”
when we were alone. Before Bates I addressed him
as “bishop” and if anyone else were present I
put in all the necessary “My Lords.”</p>

<p>“We shall not be alone to-night,” I told him as
we lit cigarettes in the study.</p>

<p>“Oh. I’m sorry, if it’s not rude to say so. Who
have you got with you?”</p>

<p>“Edmund.”</p>

<p>“Oh, good! I’ve always missed the wicked
brother, and I long to meet him. I do hope he is
not reformed or anything disastrous?”</p>

<p>“I hardly know yet. He’s quite prosperous
this time.”</p>

<p>“Ah? Well, perhaps it’s ill-gotten gains and quite
interesting. I want to hear his adventures from
himself.”</p>

<p>“So no doubt you will. But I must warn you
there is a stranger as well.”</p>

<p>The bishop’s face fell. “So I suppose I won’t
be able to wear my ‘tea-gown,’” he said.</p>

<p>I tried to explain Captain Welfare, as well as one
can explain a man one has never seen.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[51]</span>“I think we may be a most interesting party,”
said the bishop. “I wish Captain Welfare would
turn out to be a pirate in disguise. It would be
so refreshing and stimulating. I should love to
meet a pirate with a Nonconformist conscience.”</p>

<p>During lunch our talk wandered away to the early
Byzantine Empire, and I explained my difficulties
about that old first Greco-Turkish alliance.</p>

<p>I could see that Parminter was less interested
than usual.</p>

<p>“It shows how deep the Balkan question has its
roots,” he said.</p>

<p>We went for a favourite walk of ours across the
Downs.</p>

<p>We crossed ridge after ridge, rounded and
smoothed by forgotten oceans, with delicate shades
of green and mauve blending under the March
sun like the colours on the wing of a moth.</p>

<p>Before us as we walked was the dark distant
line that marked the beginning of the Weald, and,
turning, we looked back across the grey and silver
of the Channel. Far away on our right the sun
struck a gleam of white from the cliffs of Beachy
Head. An old shepherd and his dog slouched
after a slowly moving flock of sheep on their
browsing way to Lewes. On the sky-line a string
of race-horses walked to their stables after a gallop.</p>

<p>The bishop drew long deep draughts of the keen air,
and I could see some of the care fade out of his eyes.</p>

<p>“This is England to me,” he said. “So I hope
to remember it when my time comes not to see it
any more. I hope I shall have earned the right
to forget the paved streets under the soot blanket,
and those awful rows of red-brick ‘property’—not
homes, mind you, but someone’s property,
some vulgar greedy person’s ‘property,’ where<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[52]</span>
children die, and women slave, and their husbands
avoid. You have not lived among them as I
have, and you don’t have to attend ‘Housing
Conferences.’ The cant I have had to listen to
during the last few days, from sleek unimaginative
chairmen of amateur committees of busybodies,
and aldermen from the provinces with weird voices
and ghastly accents. All these people with a lust
for spouting platitudes and a determination not to
look things in the face, with their total failure
to get anything done.”</p>

<p>“It must be very unpleasant—meeting that
sort of people.”</p>

<p>“It is. But one must do it. They stand between
all right principles and the unconsciously
suffering people, who actually vote for them!
They represent the Kakistocracy which we have
made of our pretended Democracy.”</p>

<p>I looked at the bishop.</p>

<p>His lean, humorous face was grave and earnest,
his eyes shone with enthusiasm. I saw that he
was quite serious.</p>

<p>We walked for some distance homewards in silence.</p>

<p>I have given but an outline of what the bishop
said, but it depressed me to know of all these
things going on in the great world outside my
quiet home, my somewhat paltry life. It made
me feel my own littleness and inadequacy. I
frankly admitted to myself that I had no moral
right to my wealth, that I had shirked the responsibilities
it brought with it. But if I had undertaken
them I knew that I should only have done
harm through my ignorance. I had to content
myself with being merely harmless; spending
and giving my money decently and judiciously.
The bishop had good reason to know that I was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[53]</span>
always ready to support with money any of his
schemes that required it. As a rule I had none of
Hamlet’s uncomfortable sensation that I was born
to reduce dislocations of the Time.</p>

<p>The bishop was quite distressed at a lame attempt
of mine to express something of this.</p>

<p>“My dear fellow,” he said, “we all have our
Fate and our Function. It need not trouble
your conscience that yours is somewhat pleasanter
than the average. In these days the combination
of scholar and gentleman has ceased to man the
professions. When we do find one, I think he
should be endowed by the State if necessary.
When chance endows him, as in your case, we should
thank God for it. But I ought not to have burdened
you with all these harassing things that afflict us
public men. You can’t imagine the relief it is to me
to have someone to whom I can blurt out all that is
in my mind without fear of his being ‘scandalised.’”</p>

<p>Our intimacy rendered any polite disclaimer
from me unnecessary.</p>

<p>We began to talk about Edmund, and I explained
in further detail the projects of the partners.</p>

<p>“How old did you say your brother was?”</p>

<p>“He’s about twenty-five now.”</p>

<p>“Twenty-five. Well, some men are a long time
growing up. Within limits it’s the best men that
take the longest. I am sure from all you have told
me that there’s a fine man somewhere inside your
brother. But I hope he’ll soon get tired of play.”</p>

<p>“I suppose it is just play,” I assented.</p>

<p>“It’s nothing else,” said the bishop. “And we
can’t afford to have well-bred men shirking their
job.”</p>

<p>“Sometimes I fear Edmund will never be very
different. He’s a bohemian—a marine bohemian,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[54]</span>
if such a thing is possible. But there have always
been people like him in our family.”</p>

<p>“Want of opportunity,” the bishop replied with
emphasis. “Such men are simply victims of our
social system. There is always a job for them, the
biggest kind of job. When they find it or make it,
they become our greatest men. Very often they
miss it through the hide-bound stupidity of our
organisation. However, his chance will come, it
is sure to come, if he keeps himself fit and ready
for it. But I don’t like this commercialism.”</p>

<p>“He won’t take my money, so he has to make it
pay.”</p>

<p>“Yes, of course. I hope he’ll get rich at once
and be done with it—or else fail altogether.”</p>

<p>“You don’t like the idea of the shop?”</p>

<p>“Oh, that’s only a detail. The whole thing
appears to be petty trade.”</p>

<p>“He seems to leave that almost all to his partner.”</p>

<p>“Well, I don’t think he should. We don’t know
this Captain Welfare. But anyhow, in spite of
all the modern tendency, shop-keeping is not for
gentlemen. It’s bad for them. The worst fate
that can befall a gentleman is to become ‘déclassé’.”</p>

<p>“I don’t see what else we can do with him at
present,” I protested.</p>

<p>“If he’s the kind of man I imagine, they’d take
him up at the Colonial Office. I would introduce
him to Brocklehurst myself, and he could start as
deputy commissioner or something in a place where
he would get all the adventure he’d want.”</p>

<p>“I should like that, of course. But I can’t answer
for Edmund. He’s like a man in love—with
the <i>Astarte</i>.”</p>

<p>“Oh, we’ll give him time to get over that.
There’s no hurry at his age.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[55]</span>We reached home to find that Edmund and his
partner had arrived before us.</p>

<p>We saw them walking on the lawn and went on
to meet them. They were deep in conversation
and did not hear us approaching on the soft turf, so
that we were close to them when they turned and
faced us. Edmund was speaking and I caught the
words “dry and level from the cellar to the beach.”</p>

<p>I remember a feeling of amusement that he should
so soon be inflicting his obsession with the underground
passage on Captain Welfare, whom I did
not associate with antiquarian research. But this
was swallowed up in my curiosity as to the personality
of that mariner.</p>

<p>Edmund stopped short, naturally surprised at
the unexpected presence of the bishop.</p>

<p>My first impression of Welfare was his look of astonishment,
almost of fear, at finding himself in so august
a presence. For an instant he looked like a man who
thought himself trapped. Edmund hastily introduced
him to me and he said “Pleased to meet you.”</p>

<p>I presented them both to the bishop.</p>

<p>Captain Welfare said “Pleased to meet your
Lordship,” and kept his bowler hat in his hand as
we all strolled back to the house.</p>

<p>It was that terribly uncomfortable hour after
six when tea is out of the question, and one does
not know what to do with a stranger before dinner.</p>

<p>“Have you had tea?” I asked Edmund.</p>

<p>“No thanks. We only got here ten minutes ago.
Bates offered us some, but we didn’t want it. I was
just showing Welfare the view before it got dark.”</p>

<p>“Very charming prospect, sir,” said Welfare.
“Very eligible place altogether I call it.”</p>

<p>“Come in to the study. There’s time for a cigarette
before we dress.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[56]</span>The moment I said it, it occurred to me that
perhaps Captain Welfare did not dress for dinner.
I looked apprehensively to Edmund, who understood
and nodded reassuringly.</p>

<p>I handed round cigarettes.</p>

<p>“Would you like anything else, Captain Welfare?
After your journey? Edmund, I’m sure you want
a whisky-and-soda.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I think I do,” said Edmund ringing the bell.</p>

<p>“No whisky for me, thank you,” said Welfare.
“Perhaps if you have a sherry and bitters?”</p>

<p>“That’s an excellent idea,” said the bishop.
“You haven’t asked me, Davoren, but I think
I’ll join Captain Welfare in a glass of sherry.”</p>

<p>I had always admired Parminter’s tact, and now
Captain Welfare was manifestly gratified with
the sense of having done the right thing under
difficult circumstances.</p>

<p>Captain Welfare was kind enough to praise my
sherry.</p>

<p>“I hadn’t ought to have put any bitters in it,”
he said. “It puts me in mind of the Green Man
at Southampton, a little place near the docks.
Naturally you wouldn’t know it. But they give
you a glass of sherry there——”</p>

<p>He went on with this topic in a kind of meditative
way, as if he had forgotten to stop talking.</p>

<p>As there was evidently no necessity to attend to
his story, I took the opportunity of examining
him more closely.</p>

<p>His short powerful figure was curiously like
what I had expected. But his face was quite a
surprise to me. Most strange faces are somehow
familiar. I suppose they fall into one or other of
certain categories of faces we have unconsciously
formed in our minds.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[57]</span>This face was extraordinarily large, forming, as
it were, the front wall of a massive head which was
scarcely raised above his wide shoulders by a thick
and very strong neck. I had noticed that while
he was standing up. Now as he lay back in his chair
the edge of his low collar made a groove in the
flesh under his jaw, and his large indented chin
almost filled up the opening of his waistcoat.</p>

<p>His complexion was quite colourless. I thought
at first it was scarred by small-pox, but the reticulations
in his tough skin were finer than those left
by that disease. I don’t know if I am right about
this, but it looked as if no hair grew on this sterile
surface. I doubt if any razor could have shaved
it. His vertical forehead, short straight nose, wide
but well closed mouth and powerful chin were
all rather admirable in a slightly grotesque way.
He had undoubtedly the look of a man of considerable
force and determination. But his large,
well-shaped, greenish-brown eyes had a curious
dreaminess in them, and something of the wistfulness
of those of a small monkey.</p>

<p>I thought as he sat there how impossible it would
be from his appearance to determine either his
age or his occupation. I could conceive of him
as an ecclesiastic, a lawyer, a tailor, or an actor.
But nothing about him suggested the mariner.
It is a curious fact that in whatever line of life my
fancy placed him, I pictured him at the head of it
as a cardinal, a Lord Chancellor, or a Scotch
comedian. Yet he had been apparently an indifferent
success as an adventurer. I thought of the
bishop’s dictum—“Want of opportunity,” and
wondered if the <i>Astarte</i> was destined to give this
man his belated chance?</p>

<p>He was at all events physically hard and well-conditioned,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[58]</span>
evidently a man accustomed to self-control.
As his appearance became gradually
more familiar I found something strangely likeable
in it.</p>

<p>His conversation so far was evidently a thing
of habit, a mechanical process like most people’s
reading, quite unrelated to any cerebral process
behind it. I began to wish that he would stop
doing it and let us talk.</p>

<p>Through the vision he had unwittingly called up
in my mind of a frowsy bar-parlour with seafaring
men on horse-hair seats expectorating and
drinking sherry, I heard the bishop apologising to
Edmund for his presence.</p>

<p>“I did give your brother a chance of putting me
off,” he explained; “but he was too kind to do it.
We don’t often meet, and he knows how I value
these little escapes into his delightful bachelordom.
Besides, he knew how much I wanted to make
your acquaintance.”</p>

<p>“It’s very kind of you to come in spite of us,
my Lord,” said Edmund. “I’m afraid we’ll be
rather in the way of your Byzantine conversation.”</p>

<p>“From what your brother has told me, I should
say you and Captain Welfare have more of the
Byzantine spirit than either of us.”</p>

<p>“The worst of me is that I don’t even know
what the Byzantine spirit is!” Edmund warned
him.</p>

<p>“And we can only guess,” said the bishop.
“But they strove and fought, and they did make
an Empire out of the ruins of an older one—even
if they didn’t make a very good one.”</p>

<p>“I’m afraid,” said Edmund with a self-conscious
smile, “Welfare and I cannot pretend to be empire-builders.
We’re only business men and sailors.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[59]</span>“Those are two of the essentials. But I don’t
think it’s empire-builders we want. It’s empire-repairers.”</p>

<p>Edmund waited when the bishop and Captain
Welfare went to their rooms.</p>

<p>“Why on earth didn’t you put the bishop off?”
he asked a little irritably.</p>

<p>“I’ve just heard Parminter explaining to you.
Really it’s just as he said.”</p>

<p>“That’s all very well. But you can see for
yourself. Welfare is a very good partner for me
to have. He’s all right on board ship. But one
doesn’t exactly want to brandish him in the faces
of one’s friends.”</p>

<p>“I think I shall like him. And if he’ll only tell
us about himself and his life, I’m sure he’ll be interesting.”</p>

<p>“Are you going to charge the bishop something
extra for seeing him fed?”</p>

<p>“My dear Edmund, when you know Parminter
better, you’ll be as fond of him as I am. You
will understand that his interest in both of us is a
really brotherly feeling.”</p>

<p>“Well, I wish he’d get it fixed in his head that
we’re traders, fruit-merchants, out for a profit, and
not go gassing about empire-building and cant.”</p>

<p>I saw now what was causing Edmund’s irritability.
It was the consciousness, or at least the fear of
becoming <i>déclassé</i>.</p>

<p>“It’s not cant with Parminter,” I said. “He’s
tremendously keen on meeting men out of the
beaten track; men who live in an original way.
And yours is an original way. I think he’s got
an idea that this old country has got to be jerked
out of its ruts by original men. Although he’s a
bishop he has sort of lost faith in respectability.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[60]</span>“By jove, I didn’t know a bishop could have so
much sense!”</p>

<p>“I’m afraid I haven’t expressed it quite right.
But you’ll understand what I mean when you have
seen more of him.”</p>

<p>Edmund went upstairs mollified and quite cheerful,
and I was able to congratulate myself on having
restored the situation. For I was a little nervous
about the success of my curiously assorted party.</p>

<p>The bishop came down in full episcopal evening
splendour, silk stockings, silver buckles, and purple
coat.</p>

<p>“The admirable Bates evidently considered these
things necessary,” he said, looking down with a
sigh. “He left me no alternative.”</p>

<p>“Bates has doubtless scented a nonconformist
in Captain Welfare. He would be jealous of the
dignity of the church in such company.”</p>

<p>“For myself,” said the bishop, “I would have
inclined to any little concession that might soften
the dissenter’s preconceived idea of the arrogance
of the episcopacy. But Bates’s instinct is probably
right.”</p>

<p>“It always is,” I said, and then Welfare came in.</p>

<p>His evening raiment was quite correct and good
and gave his heavy face an air almost of distinction.
His only marked peculiarity was a brilliant red
silk handkerchief folded inside his waistcoat, and
showing for about an inch above its opening. I
thought it quite an effective patch of colour.</p>

<p>The bishop told me afterwards that it was considered
quite essential among the numerous class who
had recently adopted the evening dress of civilisation
as a ceremonial costume.</p>

<p>“In the north of England,” he said, “parliamentary
candidates have to display this red badge<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[61]</span>
at mayoral receptions and such functions, whatever
their political colour may be. I have never
heard of anyone wearing a blue one.”</p>

<p>Bates’s instinct had not been at fault, and it was
clear that Captain Welfare was gratified by the
bishop’s apparel. He seemed at first a little oppressed
by the ritual of dinner. Not that there
was anything unbecoming to a country vicar about
my table.</p>

<p>But when I reflected how much the element of
squalor must have entered into his life, how little
he must have seen of the routine of a comfortable
English home, I understood that my inherited
plate and glass, the damask which was Mrs. Rattray’s
tender care, the arrangement of flowers in
which my gardener gratified his pride, the shaded
candles, and the quiet, sympathetic ministrations
of Bates and a parlour-maid, must all seem
unfamiliar, even grandiose, to Captain Welfare.
He seemed subdued and impressed, watchful but
happy.</p>

<p>Edmund had been telling us of the beauties and
the discomforts of the Eastern Mediterranean.</p>

<p>“I suppose,” said the bishop, “you will eventually
be running quite a fleet of boats as your
business extends?”</p>

<p>Edmund looked across to Welfare as though
doubtful how to reply.</p>

<p>“No, my Lord,” said Welfare. “It wouldn’t
pay to extend. It’s too personal a business. We’ve
only had the <i>Astarte</i> a little more than a year,
but she’s paid for herself, for a new suit of sails,
and a new copper bottom. Now it’s all profit and
I don’t mind saying she’s making us a big percentage.
But another boat without us aboard wouldn’t
do it. It’s knowing the trade and knowing the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[62]</span>
natives and working your boat yourself. And of
course there’s side issues to the trade. This
Brighton business we’re starting is one. I guess
we’ll make enough to retire on out of the <i>Astarte</i>.”</p>

<p>“Do you think you’ll want to retire?” asked the
bishop.</p>

<p>Captain Welfare looked at him with a puzzled
expression in his wistful eyes.</p>

<p>“Well,” he said, “what’s one in business for?”</p>

<p>“Surely not merely to get out of it? It’s a
dangerous thing to retire, Captain Welfare. I’ve
seen a lot of men in the Services retired under the
sixty-three years rule. They’ve been active, useful,
young-seeming men, keenly looking forward
to enjoying their pensions. But, when it’s come,
they’ve grown old and boring all at once, simply
tumbled headlong into old age, and very often
they’ve died in a year or two. You won’t want to
retire, will you, Davoren?”</p>

<p>“Oh, I should simply knock about in some other
part of the sea,” said Edmund.</p>

<p>“I don’t know how it may look to gentlemen
waiting for pensions,” Captain Welfare remarked
with deliberation. “They’re gentlemen all the
time. But it’s different in business. I don’t see
how a man can help wanting to make his bit and
get out of it. I hope you gentlemen won’t think
the worse of me when I tell you my father was a
man who got his living in his shirt sleeves.”</p>

<p>The bishop and I made appreciative noises.
Edmund emptied his glass and threw a savage
but quite ineffectual look at his partner.</p>

<p>“Yes. He had a dry-salter’s business in a small
town in Lancashire. He always said he looked
forward to putting on his coat for the last time and
being a gentleman. He had his eye on a little house<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[63]</span>
in Southport with two bay windows. He never
managed it, poor man. It was partly my fault.
I never took to the business and didn’t give him
the help he had a right to expect. I was considered
bright at school too, and the lessons were no trouble
to me, but I couldn’t see any <i>use</i> in the things I
learned, or in the dry-salting. So I got aboard a
ship at Liverpool, as boy. It upset the old man
a good deal, but it didn’t break his heart. It was
kidney-trouble carried him off.”</p>

<p>“By the way, I’ve often wondered what a dry-salter
is?” said the bishop.</p>

<p>“Well, I don’t rightly know. I’m not sure if
anyone does nowadays. I think it’s an old-fashioned
sort of name. Father sold Epsom salts, and sulphur
and things, wholesale to the druggists, but
he sold paint and turps and varnish and paraffin
and patent medicines. Oh, and soap and candles
and brushes. I think a dry-salter can sell pretty
well anything he has a mind to.”</p>

<p>“Well, of course these things must be distributed,”
the bishop said. “It’s useful necessary work.
But I can understand a man not wanting to go
on doing it all his life. And yet we’re all of us
better, and look better, in our shirt sleeves.”</p>

<p>Captain Welfare looked sceptically at the bishop,
as though he feared he were being mocked. I
had a horrible fear that he might attempt some
sarcasm about lawn sleeves. But if he thought
of it his manners were too good to permit him to
utter it.</p>

<p>“What I mean is that there ought to be more
in life, for all of us, than merely ‘making a living,’
and waiting for death in more or less discomfort.”</p>

<p>“There’s preparing for the next world, my Lord,”
Welfare said solemnly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[64]</span>The bishop looked suspicious at once.</p>

<p>“I didn’t mean anything of that sort,” he said.
“I’m afraid I don’t understand.”</p>

<p>“Well, I suppose a man has a better chance of
making his peace with his Creator when he’s out
of business and—and isn’t distracted like.”</p>

<p>“No, I don’t see that. I cannot anyhow think
of the Creator as condescending to be at war with
his creature, or conceive of Almighty God deriving
any gratification from the worship of people who
have nothing else to do.”</p>

<p>“Of course it’s not for me to argue with your
Lordship. I was brought up Chapel, and learned
to stick to the Good Old Book.”</p>

<p>“Have a walnut, Welfare,” said Edmund pushing
a dish across to him.</p>

<p>Of course I had known he was hating the conversation,
but there had been no chance to intervene.
Parminter had an intense curiosity about the religious
ideas of laymen, and I knew that to him it would
be an irresistible temptation to dredge in the mind
of so unfamiliar a specimen as Captain Welfare.
I too would have enjoyed it but that I knew Edmund’s
sensitiveness would revolt at the idea of
his partner being regarded as on exhibition. He
wanted to be loyal to Welfare, to have him, as it
were, accepted, without having his peculiarities
emphasised.</p>

<p>On the whole I hoped Edmund’s intervention
would be successful, and seconded his effort by
starting the port on its second journey round the
table.</p>

<p>Just then the hollow thud and ring of the hammer
on soft iron and anvil was distinctly heard from
beneath the floor and diverted the thoughts of us
all.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[65]</span>Captain Welfare looked almost startled, and
then glanced enquiringly at Edmund.</p>

<p>“Somebody’s getting his horse shod out of
hours,” said the bishop. “The sound seems plainer
than ever to-night. Have you heard it before,
Captain Welfare?”</p>

<p>“No, my Lord. Mr. Davoren was just telling
me something about it when you came up.”</p>

<p>“Edmund has been exploring and opening up the
fabled passage, which proves to be quite genuine.”</p>

<p>“Really? What did you find, Mr. Davoren?”</p>

<p>“Oh, the passage is all right. Bates and I only
shifted some rubbish in places and shored up the
roof here and there. There’s a good sound passage
with a vaulted roof right down to the beach.”</p>

<p>“And you think it was really a smugglers’
passage?”</p>

<p>I explained my theory of its Saxon origin.</p>

<p>“It should be quite an important find. You
must have old Smith and some other experts down.”</p>

<p>“Some day,” I said, “but we’re keeping it to
ourselves for a bit.”</p>

<p>“I see,” said the bishop. “Yes. Those antiquarians
are a hungry horde, Davoren.”</p>

<p>“They would probably dig up the whole of my
lawn, and undermine the foundations of the poor
old house.”</p>

<p>“Quite true. I understand your feelings. I
shall keep your secret.”</p>

<p>Captain Welfare had watched us thoughtfully
during the discussion, and I thought he seemed
relieved at my decision.</p>

<p>“Your brother tells me you think of having a
cruise in the <i>Astarte</i>, sir?” he said abruptly.</p>

<p>“I should like it immensely, some day when I
can get away.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[66]</span>“Well, we’ve some business in Guernsey before
we go back East. I thought of making the trip as
soon as we’ve fixed up the Brighton business and
put in our manager there. In about a fortnight,
I hope.”</p>

<p>“You go, Davoren,” said the bishop, “you’ll
be quite in time to see the bulbs at their best. And
I’ve just the man to take your duty. One of my
unfortunate out-of-work clergy depending on guineas
for Sunday duty. A few weeks here would do
him no end of good, and he’s perfectly civilised
and harmless.”</p>

<p>“I reckon that about settles it,” said Captain
Welfare.</p>

<p>“I only wish I could go too,” said the bishop.</p>

<p>Captain Welfare’s countenance exhibited a sudden
astonishment, which faded into the pain of a
hospitable man compelled to withhold an impossible
invitation.</p>

<p>“That would be a great honour, my Lord. But
I’m afraid—our accommodation——”</p>

<p>“Oh! I’m sure that would be all and more than
I desire or deserve. But don’t worry. I could
no more get away than fly.”</p>

<p>Welfare tried to hide his obvious relief in a long
sip of his port.</p>

<p>“I don’t drink port as a rule,” said the bishop,
“but you must allow me one glass, Davoren, for
a toast—Success to the <i>Astarte</i>.”</p>

<p>I was astounded at a look of horror in Captain
Welfare’s face, as if he had witnessed an act of
sacrilege.</p>

<p>Edmund gave a cynical laugh as he raised his
glass.</p>

<p>“The <i>Astarte</i>,” said I, as I emptied mine, and
rose to return to the study.</p>

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[67]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER IV<br>

<small>I SAIL IN THE <i>ASTARTE</i></small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">WE all went to bed early that night, but
before we went there was a good deal
of talk about my holiday on the
<i>Astarte</i>.</p>

<p>Captain Welfare seemed keen on my going.
Edmund kept himself curiously aloof from the
conversation.</p>

<p>I had the idea that he wanted to dispose of
the business side of the matter first. I was determined
to become, if possible, a part owner of the
<i>Astarte</i>, and all the enterprise associated with
her. But it was impossible to discuss actual
business until the three of us were alone.</p>

<p>The bishop was innocently emphatic on the
subject of my voyage.</p>

<p>He insisted that I wanted a “change,” and
that the longer I stopped away the better for
his starveling protégé, who was to occupy my
house, and preach sermons in my absence.</p>

<p>So the subject was bandied about until we came
down to details, and I began to realise that I was
really going to sail with them.</p>

<p>A fortnight’s yachting is no great enterprise;
but I had somehow a kind of reluctance. I think
this was determined by Edmund’s aloofness. He
had been, I thought, a little “queer” all the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[68]</span>
evening, and I had a feeling that he did not want
me to start.</p>

<p>But Captain Welfare was pressing in his invitation,
and the bishop, in his kindness for me, backed
him up.</p>

<p>So before we parted, the rather hazy project
had become a definite plan, and I had promised
to send the bishop due notice of the date when
I should be ready for my locum tenens.</p>

<p>“Remember,” he said as he bade good-bye the
next morning, “if you’re away six months it
will be all the better for poor Snape. Much as I
shall miss you personally, I give you indefinite
leave.”</p>

<p>During the next fortnight Captain Welfare
and Edmund were much away on business. The
furnishing of the shop was completed, and the
stock brought down from London.</p>

<p>A young Jew was installed as manager. He
was sleek and ingratiating in his manner. I tried
my hardest to persuade myself that I liked him,
upbraiding myself for insular prejudices.</p>

<p>However, Captain Welfare vouched for his integrity
and knowledge of the business. He had been
born and bred in the Levant, he said, and was
an expert in Oriental bric-à-brac. I was compelled
to admit, when I saw our emporium as arrayed
by him, that he had much of the artistic instinct
of his race.</p>

<p>There was in the small window only a single
very beautiful Shiraz rug, which hid the interior
of the shop, and formed a background for a couple
of brass and copper vases inlaid with hammered
silver.</p>

<p>Inside, the polished floor was covered with a
few more Shiraz and Khorassan rugs. There was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[69]</span>
a large screen and some chairs of mesharabieh
work. Small electric lights, hidden in imitation
mosque lamps of Egyptian brasswork, depending
from the ceiling, lit the room with a mysterious
glow. In the background a couple of luxurious
couches flanked a low table whose top was formed
of an immense brass tray. Here Turkish coffee
and cigarettes were always ready for visitors, whether
purchasing or not. On shelves around the sides,
the dim light was reflected in stray gleams from
brass and copper-ware and pottery, and faintly
lit up silks and embroidery, and a museum of
native work, curios, and “anticas” from all the
countries of the East.</p>

<p>“It’s not in the least like a shop,” I said with
an involuntary note of relief, as I sipped a cup
of excellent though syrupy coffee.</p>

<p>“It’s like an Eastern Shop,” Edmund explained.
“And we’re going to run it on Eastern lines, bargaining,
coffee, and a bit of rubbish as ‘backshish,’
and all.”</p>

<p>“There is very much money in that, sir,” said
the Barber’s Block, so I had mentally christened
our Hebrew manager. He had the delicate beauty
of one of those waxen heads on which hair-dressers
sometimes exhibit their wigs, and his teeth reminded
me of those lovely designs in pearl and coral that
one sees displayed in glass cases outside the doors
of the humbler kind of dentists.</p>

<p>He had his own atmosphere too, like a perfumed
asteroid. He revolted me, and I knew that there
was something subtly, disgustingly attractive about
him.</p>

<p>“We ask one pound,” he continued, “for something
we can sell for eight-and-six and have our
profit, and very often we get twelve or fifteen<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[70]</span>
shillings, and the customer is more pleased than
if we ask eight-and-six, and he pays it. So we
give him some little thing, ‘backshish,’ and almost
always he buys something more.”</p>

<p>This account of our business methods was
extremely disagreeable to me and I remarked:</p>

<p>“I think it’s a rotten way of doing business.”</p>

<p>“It is always so in the East.”</p>

<p>His air of imperturbable finality made me feel
merely foolish and fussy. I realised he had dignity
in his way.</p>

<p>“He’s quite right,” Edmund agreed, “we’ve
got to make this a little bit of the East. After
all, throwing in the customs is one way of giving
people the genuine article. They get a whiff of
Cairo along with their purchase, and it’s well worth
the money.”</p>

<p>“Well, I want to be the first customer anyhow.
How much is this?” I asked, picking up a little
Japanese netsuké in dusky ivory.</p>

<p>“That one I can sell for ten shillings and make
a profit. This one I lose if I sell for thirty shillings.”</p>

<p>“But I like this one best.”</p>

<p>“No, it is not so good. See, it has not the
signature of the artist. But it is here on this
one.”</p>

<p>He pointed out some minute Japanese writing
cut in a tiny square.</p>

<p>“Never buy any work of a Japanese artist
without the signature. He signs only what is
best—perfect.”</p>

<p>“All the same,” I said, “I’ll take this cheap
one for luck and because I like it.”</p>

<p>He smiled as he gave me the change.</p>

<p>“I would have sold the pair for four guineas,”
he said.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[71]</span>Edmund laughed.</p>

<p>“I think our friend Iscariot will manage very
well for us,” he whispered.</p>

<p>He never called him anything else, and Mr.
Schultz appeared to have no objection to his nickname.</p>

<p>During this period I learned an extraordinary
number of things about some of the practical
commercial affairs of life, and I was surprised
and somewhat gratified at the energy and capacity
displayed by Captain Welfare, and indeed by
Edmund too.</p>

<p>It was soon evident that the shop was going to
be a paying concern. In the slang of the day
“it caught on.” I had always had a general
idea that shop-keepers made very large sums of
money except when they failed altogether, but I
never could understand how they did it. It seemed
to me that if they sold expensive things their
customers were too few, and if they sold cheap
things their profits must be too small to afford
them a comfortable interest on their capital. I
do not understand this yet, except in the case of
people like butchers, and publicans, and very
large shops that are crowded with people all day.</p>

<p>But when I learned what our “takings,” as
they called them, amounted to on the first day,
my fear was that the whole stock would disappear
in a week. But Captain Welfare assured me we
could double our sales and carry on till long after
the arrival of our next consignment from the East.</p>

<p>I asked him if he was quite satisfied to leave
everything in the hands of Mr. Schultz.</p>

<p>“Oh yes. We’ve given him sufficient interest
in the business to keep him straight. We shall
take stock twice a year, so he could only swindle<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[72]</span>
us for six months in any case. It will pay him
better to be honest. Oh yes! he has plenty of
good reasons for playing fair with me. I’ve done
business with him since he was a nipper with bare
legs doing conjuring tricks on the foot-walks of
Port Said.”</p>

<p>“You think he is grateful?”</p>

<p>“No, I don’t. He’s a low-class Jew. But he’ll
not run any rigs with me for the present.”</p>

<p>I dropped the subject, which was one I did not
care to dwell on in any case.</p>

<p>We had come to a general agreement as to the
terms on which I was to become a partner, and
my lawyer came down to take my instructions
and prepare the necessary deed.</p>

<p>Marshall was a personal friend of mine and I
never transacted any business except through him,
with the exception of the matters that were naturally
in the hands of my agents in Ireland.</p>

<p>He had, I knew, a considerable affection for
me, and respected my literary work as beseeming
a man in my position. But he detested my pigeons,
and always disapproved of any suggestions of mine
concerning my own property. He had always
disapproved too of Edmund, whom he had never
met.</p>

<p>“Put him on an allowance and stick to it,”
he always said.</p>

<p>It was in vain that I explained that Edmund
refused an allowance. This only made Marshall
snort.</p>

<p>I dreaded intensely telling him of my present
proposals.</p>

<p>He listened to my story in absolute silence,
which made me more and more nervous as I went
on.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[73]</span>His lips stuck out in an unpleasant way which
reminded me of the Psalmist’s description of those
hateful people who used to say “tush” to the godly.</p>

<p>My account of the enterprise began to seem
unconvincing even to myself as it had never done
before, and the narrative tailed off on a note of
apology, which for the life of me I could not keep
out of it.</p>

<p>“That’s all you know about the business?” he
asked.</p>

<p>“Yes. I think so.”</p>

<p>“My dear Davoren, you’ve wasted my time
and your own money bringing me down here.”</p>

<p>“I’m sorry; but why?”</p>

<p>“You don’t want a lawyer, you want a doctor.”</p>

<p>“Oh! no thanks. I don’t care about doctors
while I’m well. They talk shop and smell of
iodoform, or whatever they call the stuff.”</p>

<p>“You want a mental specialist, what they
call an alienist.”</p>

<p>“I’ve always wondered why they call them
that?”</p>

<p>“You can look it up in the dictionary. But
that’s not the point. You must consult one.
You’re ill.”</p>

<p>“Oh? I hadn’t noticed it. Bates hasn’t said
anything about it.”</p>

<p>“I presume you have not informed Bates that
you propose to embark not only your capital,
but your self, on a rickety old Levantine schooner
with a crew of cut-throat niggers, a young scapegrace
of a brother, and some kind of a sea-captain,
about whom you know nothing whatever, except
that he has spent his life trying to pick up a
precarious living among all sorts of dagoes in the
East.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[74]</span>“Edmund is a pretty good judge of a boat, you
know, and if she has come here from the Mediterranean
she ought to be able to take me to the
Channel Islands and back.”</p>

<p>Marshall only snorted in the way that I particularly
loathed.</p>

<p>“Anyhow,” I continued, “my taking a trip for
pleasure is no part of the business. It does not
come into the agreement. As for the money,
you know I should not be ruined by the loss of a
couple of thousand pounds, though I don’t want to
lose it, and I don’t believe I shall. I’m doing it to
help Edmund.”</p>

<p>“Well, I won’t draft any such damned agreement!”</p>

<p>“I’m sorry. I shall have to get somebody
in Brighton. Who is the best solicitor there?”</p>

<p>“I had better recommend you to the worst, I
think. But, seriously, Davoren, are you going on
with this?”</p>

<p>“Certainly I am. I’ve promised.”</p>

<p>“Well, in that case I had better protect you
to the best of my ability.”</p>

<p>I was immensely gratified to find I had won a
victory at such a comparatively small cost to my
self-respect.</p>

<p>Marshall went to my desk and began to write
hurriedly, and very soon “This Indenture Witnessed
that Whereas &amp;c.” I made a transitory appearance
in the document under my proper name and title,
being “herein-after known” as something else,
as which I should never have recognised myself.
I had always a difficulty in understanding this
kind of composition, and Marshall’s essay was
no exception to the rule. But I gathered that
the payment to me of five per cent. on my capital<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[75]</span>
was to be a first charge on the assets and profits
of the concern, and was to be independent of any
agreed share of such profits “if and when accruing.”</p>

<p>There was another clause empowering me at any
time to have all “ships, vessels, premises, stock-in-trade,
books, accounts,” and various other
things which might or might not be our property,
examined, inspected, valued, and various other
things done to them, by an accountant to be
nominated by me, and who was to make me an
account, and do all sorts of other arduous things
which would have conveyed nothing whatever to me.</p>

<p>I protested against both these clauses; against
the first as showing avarice, and against the second
as suggesting suspicion.</p>

<p>“I don’t think Captain Welfare would like
it,” I said.</p>

<p>“I don’t expect for a moment that he will,”
Marshall replied grimly, “but they’re going in
all the same. That’s what I am here for.”</p>

<p>I had gained so much of my own way that I
did not care to contest the point. Besides, I
reflected, I could explain to Edmund that I didn’t
intend to act on either of them.</p>

<p>When the drafts of the agreement came down
for signature, however, Welfare took them quite
as a matter of course and assured me he would
have insisted on them himself.</p>

<p>I wrote and told Marshall this, but he had conceived
an inveterate prejudice against Welfare.</p>

<p>We were now in the beginning of April, with the
spring coming in like a flood-tide and all was
ready for our start. Mr. Snape was coming to
be introduced to the parish, and a boyish feeling
of emancipation and excitement was making me
feel rather absurd to myself.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[76]</span>I wanted to go with them to Tilbury, so as to
have as much sailing as possible, but it appeared
that there were objections to this. They agreed that
the <i>Astarte</i> would want a lot of furbishing up before
she was ready to receive a guest.</p>

<p>“I want you to see her at her best,” Edmund
said.</p>

<p>It was almost the first time he had spoken cordially
about my going at all, so I readily gave up the
point.</p>

<p>“What about Newhaven? It’s the nearest
port,” I said.</p>

<p>“Oh, Newhaven or Dover would be all right,”
said Edmund.</p>

<p>“I’ll tell you what,” said Captain Welfare.
“I’ve been looking at the beach down below here.
It’s a nice handy cove for landing, and there’s
soundings enough for the <i>Astarte</i> up to within a
quarter mile of the shore. Why not let us lie to
and take you off right here? We’d save time
and harbour dues, and economy’s the motto for the
<i>Astarte</i>.”</p>

<p>“That’s an A1 idea, Welfare,” said Edmund.</p>

<p>It appealed to me too in my new-born spring
mood of adventure. I agreed at once.</p>

<p>“And we’ll have your kit taken down by the
famous tunnel and so make some use of it.”</p>

<p>Even my repugnance to the idea of that passage
had vanished, and I consented to this arrangement
also. It added a touch of mystery to the
adventure.</p>

<p>“Talking of that passage,” said Captain Welfare,
“we’d save railway freight if we brought the
rest of the stuff for the shop along with us. If
Mr. Davoren wouldn’t mind storing it till Schultz
can fetch it?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[77]</span>“Not a bit. It would be all right in the cellar,
I suppose?”</p>

<p>“Oh, certainly. The men will carry it up the
passage and store it till it can be fetched. It’ll
save a lot of handling, as Schultz can have it all
brought straight to the shop by road.”</p>

<p>It all seemed to me a perfectly natural and
convenient arrangement, and I remember laughingly
stipulating with Edmund that he should drive
away the bats before I ventured down the passage.</p>

<p>They left the next day, expecting to be away
about a week.</p>

<p>I was to receive a post-card telling me as nearly
as possible when the <i>Astarte</i> would fetch up.</p>

<p>I was left alone with my locum tenens, Mr.
Snape. I fear he found me an uneasy host.</p>

<p>He was a terribly earnest young man, who had
made himself ill by overworking and under-feeding
in slum parishes.</p>

<p>He was the kind of clergyman who is always
described as a “good organiser.” In certain circles
this is the highest praise that can be bestowed
on a clergyman. I never quite understood what
it meant, or what these people organised. I
always vaguely associated it with having printed
tickets for things, and lists of names.</p>

<p>He was very polite and agreeable, and even
inclined to be deferential to me, I suppose regarding
me as a man of comparative wealth, and possibly
impressed by my position as a Justice of the Peace,
a position that had been forced upon me, for which
I was quite unfitted, and of which I certainly
was not proud. I only supposed these were the
reasons for his deference, because he had never
heard of my historical researches, or of my reputation
as a pigeon-fancier.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[78]</span>In spite of this, and without at all intending
it, he made me feel that he was shocked.</p>

<p>The modest comfort of my habits shocked his
ascetic instinct. He was shocked by my not
saying grace before dinner, and bowed his head
and crossed himself in silence before he took his
soup. I knew this would upset Bates, who is
an Evangelical of rather strong views. If I had
only thought of it, I would have said some ordinary
sort of grace myself, which Bates would not have
minded nearly so much.</p>

<p>But it was worse when he began to question me
about the “parochial organisation,” and discovered
that there was no communicants’ guild,
no G.F.S. (I had to think hard before I could remember
what a G.F.S. was), no lads’ brigade, no
mothers’ union—none of the things he thought
there ought to be. I had never before realised
the utter nakedness of my parish in the paraphernalia
of organised soul-saving.</p>

<p>Poor Snape, who was a gentleman, was more
embarrassed than myself.</p>

<p>“Is there much debt on the church?” he asked
after a pause.</p>

<p>“Not a penny,” I said, brightening up, for
the moderate debt that I had found I had myself
paid off, and I thought our solvency at least was
in our favour.</p>

<p>But it was not so. Snape looked more than
ever depressed.</p>

<p>“I have always found that a debt is such a
stimulus to the laity,” he said mournfully. “It
unites them in organised efforts.”</p>

<p>“Yes, perhaps, in some places, but I’m afraid
bazaars and things would never go well in Borrowdean.
People would not understand about getting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[79]</span>
them up, or know what to do with them. They
have a great idea of getting value for their money.”</p>

<p>“But how do you work your parish, Mr. Davoren?
What do you do in it, without any of the usual
methods?”</p>

<p>“Oh, I just—potter about. They don’t behave
badly as a rule, and I try to make them behave
better. I’m always here if any of them want to
see me, or want me to visit them. I don’t think
they’d care for a parson strolling into their houses
as if he had a right to do so. Then there’s the
church. Our service is really restful and harmonious.
And of course we have a Sunday School.”</p>

<p>“Oh, of course.”</p>

<p>“Then the publican is a tenant of mine and
I insist on his selling honest liquor. I also try
to stop fellows drinking too much of it.”</p>

<p>“But do you think that the church should
countenance the public-house?”</p>

<p>“Oh yes! I think it’s most important to have
our public-houses decent, respectable, civilised
places. I often drop in to make sure all is well.”</p>

<p>“I am afraid it would be impossible for me,
as an abstainer, to do that,” he cried, dissimulating
his horror with difficulty.</p>

<p>“Of course. I should not advise you to try.
But if I were to become an abstainer, not only
should I dislike it very much myself, but nobody
would behave any the better for my sacrifice.
As it is, some of them do behave better for knowing
that I may come in to their public-house for a
chat and a glass of beer with them.”</p>

<p>I saw that Snape was not only puzzled but
pained by the unfamiliarity of my views, so I
hastened to change the subject.</p>

<p>“I think a country parson can really do a little<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[80]</span>
good for his flock by just living among them and
not putting on side,” I said. “One can help
in various ways, material and other. I have
been able, for instance, by a little timely financing
to help a young couple to get married, and so
have prevented an otherwise inevitable scandal.”</p>

<p>“But that sort of thing would be utterly impossible
in a large industrial parish!”</p>

<p>“Of course it would. But this is a small country
parish. It would have been impossible for me to
do what I have said if I had not had some private
means; though of course the young people paid
me back by degrees. But isn’t it possible that
the methods which seem best in the populous
parish may not be equally suitable in a little community
like this?”</p>

<p>Without really meaning to, I had got the better
of him in mere logic. I saw that he was distressed
by feeling that my logic, though unanswerable, was
wrong. It is a feeling I know well myself and hate.</p>

<p>“I daresay I am only defending my own laziness
and incapacity, to myself as well as to you,” I
continued. “The fact is I don’t understand
how to run these things. If you like, I shall be
delighted if you inaugurate all the organisations
you think necessary while I am away. Then
perhaps you can teach me to keep them going
when I return, if they seem to work well.”</p>

<p>“I’m afraid the time is too short,” he said
regretfully.</p>

<p>“Well then, stop on as long as necessary—on
the same terms, of course.”</p>

<p>His look of gratitude was very affecting. Yet I
regretted my hospitality; for though he commanded
my respect, he bored me terribly. I
was not uneasy about his organisation, being<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[81]</span>
confident that not even Paul and Apollos could
stimulate my Sussex parishioners to a “combined
effort.”</p>

<p>“I must ask the bishop about it,” Snape said.</p>

<p>“Do,” I said, cravenly sure that Parminter
would rescue me from the full consequences of my
impulse.</p>

<p>This was our only long conversation during the
impatient days while I waited for Edmund’s post-card.</p>

<p>A note came at last to say they were starting.
I was to begin looking out for them on the afternoon
following the day I received it. The time of their
arrival of course depended on wind and tide. I
had somehow forgotten to allow for this uncertainty
in my anticipation, and now it added to
my impatience.</p>

<p>Bates packed up my things wistfully. He had
pleaded hard to be taken, and I should have been
glad to have him in many ways. But it appeared
there was no possible accommodation for him
on the <i>Astarte</i>. Besides, I had no one else to leave
in charge of the pigeons and Snape.</p>

<p>Bates had the imagination and sympathy which
make the best kind of servant, and he conceived
of me as something utterly helpless in his absence.</p>

<p>I shook off Snape as soon as I could after lunch,
and went up on the Downs where I could get a
wide view of the Channel.</p>

<p>There was a fresh topsail breeze from the east,
a fair wind for the <i>Astarte</i>. I knew it had held
steady for forty-eight hours. It was not unreasonable
to expect that she would come up to time
or ahead of it.</p>

<p>I had an unreasoning desire to see her for which
I could not account. But I had a feeling that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[82]</span>
something was going to intervene to prevent my
sailing. When the idea had first been broached,
it had been but a matter of a trip to me. Now
it had somehow assumed an unwarranted importance.
My desire for the start filled me with
senseless apprehensiveness. I was like a schoolboy
dreading rain on his holiday.</p>

<p>I could not account for this mood in myself;
it made me uneasy, and intensely intolerant of any
society—especially Snape’s.</p>

<p>There was a warm April sun glowing on the
Downs, and glistening on the loose flints that
everywhere pushed their way up through the
chalk, and lay about among the short grass of the
sheep-pastures. The Channel was a crisp blue
under a shining sky, and the air was full of the
infinitely soothing sound of the distant calling of
sheep.</p>

<p>Peace came over me as I lay watching for the
expected sail, wondering what exotic form it
would take, trying to picture the long bowsprit
and the head-sails “like a skein of geese” that
I had been told of.</p>

<p>But the afternoon wore on and no sail came in
sight, none at least that could be the <i>Astarte</i>.</p>

<p>The wind grew cold as the sun dipped to its
setting, and I rose with a little shiver to go home,
calm but disillusioned.</p>

<p>“No sign of Mr. Edmund?” I asked deceitfully
of Bates.</p>

<p>“No, sir.”</p>

<p>I felt that the moment had passed, that he
would not now come at all, and that I should
not set sail in the <i>Astarte</i>.</p>

<p>But I did not want Bates to know I had been
watching for her all afternoon.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[83]</span>The sky had clouded over, and it was dark in
my study when I heard Edmund’s voice outside.</p>

<p>I went out and met him coming from the passage
that led to the kitchen and cellars. He must
have come up the tunnel.</p>

<p>“Hullo,” he said. “Sorry I’m late. We were
delayed starting and miscalculated the tide a
bit. We expected to get the ebb sooner, however
it will be making nicely now. How are you?
How do you do, Mr. Snape?”</p>

<p>“Is the <i>Astarte</i> here?” I asked.</p>

<p>“Of course she is. We’re not mooring her,
just keeping her lying-to till we get the stuff—the
stock I mean—ashore and take you off. Are
you quite ready?”</p>

<p>“Can’t you stop and dine?”</p>

<p>“Oh, just some soup and a snack, but we mustn’t
be long. Just while the other boat comes ashore
and we off-load her. Let’s get in to your fire.
It’s cold on the water.”</p>

<p>We went into the study and I switched on the
lights. The rosy comfort of my room struck me
with a kind of pang as I thought of leaving.</p>

<p>“Thank you, Bates, just what I wanted,” said
Edmund as Bates brought in a tray with decanter
and syphon.</p>

<p>He drank with a little shudder as though of
cold, though he did not look cold, but ill at ease.</p>

<p>Snape shuddered too as he watched him.</p>

<p>I knew that seeing a man drink a whisky-and-soda,
unsanctified even by the presence of a meal,
gave him a feeling of being in some unhallowed
presence, and filled him with a desire to protest
that was choked down only by his shyness.</p>

<p>“Get some dinner in at once, Bates,” I said,
“anything that’s ready.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[84]</span>“Got all your traps ready?”</p>

<p>“Yes. All strapped and waiting. I had almost
given you up.”</p>

<p>After a hasty meal we walked down by the road
to the beach. Snape came with us, smiling vacuously
as though he thought we were doing something
comic, but couldn’t see the joke.</p>

<p>“The niggers can bring your kit down when
they have stowed away the goods,” Edmund said.</p>

<p>It would be long before the moon, nearing its
last quarter, rose. The only light was from a
pale border of sky in the west under the straight
edge of the great cloud mass that had overspread
the firmament.</p>

<p>It had rained a little, and the roofs of cottages
and loose stones on the beach gleamed feebly
in the dark.</p>

<p>The sea broke dully on the shore, each wave
drawing away from the shingle with a regretful
sound. A dark blotch on the edge with two
motionless figures beside it was the dinghy.</p>

<p>As my eyes grew accustomed to the faint light
I could make out a dim nucleus of blackness against
the dull pewter of the sea. This was all we could
see of the <i>Astarte</i>. She looked a long way off in
the gloom.</p>

<p>Presently Edmund said, “There comes the
boat.”</p>

<p>I could see nothing, but very soon I heard the
double-knock of oars in rowlocks. Then a moving
blackness became visible with pale flashes from the
blades of the oars.</p>

<p>The boat was much nearer than I had judged,
for a few strokes brought her to the shore.</p>

<p>Immediately a harsh guttural gabbling broke
out among the crew, which was at once checked<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[85]</span>
by a gruff order from someone in the stern-sheets.</p>

<p>Edmund hurried down to the boat, as her crew
hauled the bow a few yards up on the beach.</p>

<p>Snape and I followed him more slowly. We
seemed to be forgotten in the silent bustle that
was taking place.</p>

<p>I could just make out the lines of an able, roomy
ship’s boat, and I was a good deal surprised at
the amount of cargo she had brought ashore. Case
after case was being handed out and stacked on
the beach. They looked like good-sized packing-cases,
and the men handled them as though they
were fairly heavy.</p>

<p>However, the crew of six had them out in about
a minute, and then each man shouldered a case
with surprising dexterity and they started in a
group stumbling up the beach under their loads.</p>

<p>In the darkness I could just make out that
some of the men had loose Turkish trousers and
some wore the long robe or galabieh of the Arab.
Their faces were invisible in the dusk, except for
glints of white from eyes and teeth, and most of
them seemed to have a white handkerchief or
turban bound round their heads.</p>

<p>Edmund and the man who had been in the stern-sheets
were talking aside in low tones, and now
they guided the laden men to the rough path in
the cliff leading to the tunnel.</p>

<p>Snape and I followed, fascinated by this strange,
impossible invasion of our quiet Sussex cove.</p>

<p>“It is quite like the old days of the smugglers!”
giggled Snape.</p>

<p>It irritated me to feel that he had no sense of
the real eerie strangeness and mystery of the scene,
and I wished I were alone.</p>

<p>I heard Edmund’s voice, almost unrecognisable<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[86]</span>
in the harsh gutturals of Arabic, giving directions,
as I guessed, about getting up the path. Then
someone slipped and I heard the quick swish
of a whip, the thud of its lash on flesh, and a growl
like that of a wounded beast.</p>

<p>I drew in my breath with a little gasp and a
throb of the heart, wondering if Edmund had
struck the blow.</p>

<p>It seemed a horrible and hideous thing to me then.</p>

<p>The two men who had been with the dinghy
now passed us also bearing loads, and three of the
first party came back for others. Edmund and
the rest had evidently gone on up the tunnel to my
cellar.</p>

<p>It was strange to me to think of these wild-looking
creatures even in the cellar of my peaceful home,
and I wondered what Bates would think of them.
I sincerely hoped that Mrs. Rattray would keep
out of their way.</p>

<p>I knew how utterly she would disapprove of
them, and feared I should sink in her estimation
by such an association.</p>

<p>And Mrs. Rattray’s good opinion was very precious
to me.</p>

<p>In an incredibly short time all the cases had
disappeared and the men were back with my
luggage.</p>

<p>Bates came to see me off, bringing some things
he had thought of at the last moment as likely
to add to my comfort.</p>

<p>“Is everything all right, Bates?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir. Everything stowed away quite
right.”</p>

<p>“What do you think of the crew?”</p>

<p>“Well, sir, I didn’t see much of them. But
I hope you’ll keep your things locked up.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[87]</span>“You think they’re thieves?”</p>

<p>“Well, I believe those sort of low-class foreigners
mostly are, sir.”</p>

<p>As we were getting into the boat Snape asked
which I thought would be the best evening for the
G.F.S.?</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” I said firmly, “ask Miss Gregson
at the post-office.”</p>

<p>I don’t know what put Miss Gregson into my
head, but as the Arabs rowed us through the night
with a strange grunt at each stroke, I felt the
Girls’ Friendly Society was very remote.</p>

<p>Edmund remained silent, and it seemed to me
there had been an air of silence and speed about
the whole proceeding that was puzzling. I regretted
it because it took away from my feeling of holiday
exhilaration.</p>

<p>“You had quite a big cargo,” I said.</p>

<p>“Must keep up the stock, you know.”</p>

<p>“Of course. I didn’t know you had so much
in reserve. How quickly these fellows handled
it. They’re very smart.”</p>

<p>“They’ve got to be smart when Jakoub is around,”
said Edmund grimly.</p>

<p>I guessed that the silent native who sat with us
in the stern was Jakoub, and remembered Edmund’s
description of him.</p>

<p>I hoped it had been he who had used the whip.</p>

<p>“Here we are,” said Edmund, as the <i>Astarte</i>
suddenly became distinct and closer to us.</p>

<p>Someone fixed the port light in its bracket.
There was no other light on deck, but a glow came
through the sky-lights covering the saloon, and
shone upwards along the tall pointed mainsail.</p>

<p>The boat was brought alongside, a short ladder
slung from the side and, as I put my foot on it, a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[88]</span>
hand grasped mine and Captain Welfare said,
“Welcome to the <i>Astarte</i>, sir.”</p>

<p>I thanked him and came aboard, followed by
Edmund and the crew. At the same time the
dinghy came alongside and was made fast.</p>

<p>There was a gruff order “Esta’ad,” followed by
other words in Arabic which had the curious effect
of fierceness to which the language lends itself.
There was a rattle as sheets were hauled down
and belayed and, with the two boats still in tow,
the <i>Astarte</i> was on the wind and gathering way.</p>

<p>My heart leaped to the glorious sensation.</p>

<p>“We’re off!” I exclaimed in surprise.</p>

<p>“Yes. We don’t want to miss any of this
tide,” said Captain Welfare. “But it’s no good
standing here in the cold and dark. Come down
to the saloon and have a look at your cabin. Get
those boats aboard, Jakoub.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER V<br>

<small>WHAT THE LITTLE STEAMER BROUGHT</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">IT was clearly impossible for me to make the
real acquaintance of the <i>Astarte</i> that night
and, as it was certainly raw and cold on
deck in the dark, I gladly followed Captain Welfare
down the companion to the saloon.</p>

<p>Here I found a most unexpected scene of comfort
and civilisation. Most of my limited experience
of yachting had been gained in small boats, and
I had foolishly modelled my anticipation of the
<i>Astarte</i> on my recollections of these. So I was
surprised at the width and spaciousness I found.</p>

<p>A powerful lamp deeply shaded in red and
suspended from the skylight lit up the table, which
was laid for some sort of late evening meal. There
were deep-red tulips in vases, and a pleasant gleam
of silver and cut glass on the white cloth. The
chairs, of course, were of the marine type, fixed in
the floor with revolving seats.</p>

<p>Over the lockers along each side were deep
luxurious seats, upholstered in dull red morocco,
and over these, between the wide port-holes,
each panel was filled with a pictorial tile of Delft
ware, with a singularly clean and restful decorative
effect of blues and browns. The further bulkhead
on either side of the narrow door leading for’ard
was filled with book-cases. A soft Persian carpet<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[90]</span>
and the curving sides of the ship, the cunning
shelves and cupboards that occupied odd corners,
all combined to produce that air of cosiness that
can be found nowhere in such perfection as in a
ship’s cabin.</p>

<p>Captain Welfare was openly delighted by my
praises of all these arrangements. There was
something comical though pathetic in his anxiety
for my approval. In fact I began to fear that
his apologetic attitude would become a little wearisome
if he persisted in it.</p>

<p>Thus he apologised for the leather upholstering
and entered into a long explanation of the reasons
for the absence of velvet. It was in vain that I
assured him with the utmost sincerity that I greatly
preferred leather. He simply did not listen. It
was evident that he himself considered that red
velvet cushions would have done me more honour,
and really deplored their absence. My protestations
he regarded as mere politeness, and he was
concerned only in his own explanations. In the same
spirit he kept apologising for the absence of many
things which I should have loathed had they been
there.</p>

<p>My cabin had been newly furnished throughout,
and I found something very touching in the almost
ladylike care which had been spent upon it.</p>

<p>I had for some time realised that, as Edmund
had said he would, Captain Welfare regarded me
as a “swell”; and simply because I was quite
unconscious of being anything of the sort, he had
conceived a queer kind of devotion to me.</p>

<p>Like the great majority of mankind, both Welfare
and Edmund were pleasantest when acting as host.
Especially Edmund, because his pride in the ship
was gratified by my real pleasure in it, and he was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[91]</span>
of course free from that well-meant but fussy
solicitude that is so common in hosts and so very
wearing for the guest.</p>

<p>After our early and hurried meal the supper
on board was most acceptable.</p>

<p>The <i>Astarte</i> was footing pleasantly before the fair
wind with very little motion, and as we chatted in
the warm light of the saloon I felt that my holiday
was going to be a great success.</p>

<p>“When do you expect to reach Guernsey?” I
asked.</p>

<p>“If this breeze holds we shall be there the morning
after to-morrow at latest,” said Captain Welfare.
“But we can’t count on it this time of year.
It may fall calm any minute. Then it will be a
matter of luck with the tides and what bits of
wind we can catch.”</p>

<p>“I’m in no hurry,” I said with a sense of luxurious
freedom, “I rather hope we shall be delayed.”</p>

<p>“Well, we’ll be a few days in Guernsey anyhow,
and then I want to go on to Jersey. I hope that
will be quite convenient to you, Mr. Davoren?”</p>

<p>“I shall be delighted. If you call at Alderney
and Sark and all the rest of them, it will be all right
to me!”</p>

<p>“I’ve heard from my correspondent in Jersey,”
said Captain Welfare with a little grandiloquence,
“of a bit of cargo there we might as well bring
back. It will help to pay our expenses.”</p>

<p>“That’s delightful. The touch of business takes
away all the sense of futility one usually has on a
yacht.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Edmund, “going to look at places
and photograph them simply because everyone
else has labelled them pretty, or picturesque, or
interesting or something. That kind of yachtsman<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[92]</span>
is only an expensive kind of tripper after all.”</p>

<p>“I’ve had good times on a yacht too, I must
admit,” I said with a retrospective sigh.</p>

<p>“And I never have,” said Edmund with sudden
bitterness. “I’ve had to watch other people, ladies
and asses in white flannels, floating into a harbour
on some millionaire cheesemonger’s 1000-tonner,
while I’ve stood, black to the eyes, watching the
dagoes coal ship, or punching niggers on some
bit of a trading scow. It’s simply a case of ‘sour
grapes’ with me, old man!”</p>

<p>He ended with a laugh that grated on me. It
was a cynical laugh, very unlike the Edmund of
old, and yet, I felt, typical of much that I had
noticed in his bearing since he had been home this
time. I did not like to think of him having been
driven to envy mere prosperous, idle people; and
I was sure there was something deeper in his resentment
than common jealousy of idleness and wealth.
The bishop’s words came back to me with painful
force—“There is nothing worse for a gentleman
than to be <i>déclassé</i>.” And with this there recurred
my old wonder, what it was that Edmund
had “surrendered”?</p>

<p>“I don’t think you need envy anybody while
you’re on the <i>Astarte</i>,” I said quietly.</p>

<p>“Oh! I haven’t a word to say against the
<i>Astarte</i>,” Edmund admitted.</p>

<p>Captain Welfare leaned back with a sigh of
relief. He had watched Edmund anxiously during
his momentary discontent. Indeed I had noticed
that he often seemed uneasy when Edmund expressed
any dissatisfaction, as though some restraint
were needed to keep him in the partnership. I
attributed this merely to the want of steadfastness
I knew so well in Edmund.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[93]</span>“Of course,” he said, as if in explanation, “we’ve
not always been on the <i>Astarte</i>. We had some
rough times before we got her, as you know, sir.
But if things go as well as they’re doing for another
three years, you’ll be able to have your own yacht,
Mr. Edmund, and bother no more about cargoes.”</p>

<p>“I shan’t want it then. Once I’m independent of
trade, I shall want to stick to it.”</p>

<p>This was of course unintelligible to Captain Welfare,
with his ideal of “retiring”; but I understood
perfectly. I said to myself, “The bishop
was right. Edmund must have some service to
perform as soon as possible.”</p>

<p>A tremendous sleepiness came upon me, and early
as it was I said good-night and turned in.</p>

<p>I was on deck betimes next morning and found
the sun well up in a clear blue April morning sky.
The <i>Astarte</i> was foaming along very gaily with free
sheets, two big square sails set on her foremast
and all her head-sails drawing. There was a fair
amount of following sea from which she lifted her
short counter with exhilarating buoyancy.</p>

<p>She struck me as bigger and more of a ship than
I had expected. The bulwarks round the afterdeck
were nearly breast high, as she had a great
deal of free-board for her size. There was a kind
of short waist amidships, covering the hold, and
a small deck over the fo’c’sle. Her slightly raking
masts and leg-o’-mutton sails looked a tremendous
height from the deck, and the whole boat seemed
to taper away to the great sloping bowsprit with
its flight of jibs. I thought what a weird-looking
craft she must be from outside. But I realised
that her lines, though strange, must be beautiful.</p>

<p>Her decks were holystoned and scrubbed to the
whiteness of paper, and the thin lines of caulking<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[94]</span>
between the planks had the polish of jet. The
inside of the bulwarks and other parts were newly
painted in green and white, and the mahogany
and brass of the sky-lights, the wheel and binnacle,
all shone with the lustre of well-tended furniture.</p>

<p>Two or three of the crew were busy about the deck.</p>

<p>Their bare legs, shining like brown silk stockings,
their bright, exotic costumes, and dark faces with
teeth flashing as they grinned and chattered at
their work, gave me a queer feeling of having been
transported in my sleep to the unknown East.</p>

<p>One of them was a thin, delicate creature with a
skin of the colour and polish of black-lead—a
Soudanese as I afterwards learned.</p>

<p>The wheel was a little abaft of the saloon companion.
It was in charge of a tall, gracefully
built Arab in a handsome blue linen galabieh.
As we were practically before the wind there was
little strain on the wheel, which he handled delicately
and instinctively with one hand. The soft fez
at the back of his head was bound with the green
of a descendant of the Prophet. His lean brown
face had an essential air of aristocracy and command
in its repose. Only his accipitrine eyes seemed
alert, intent on everything from the horizon to the
details of the work of the man nearest to him.
He reminded me irresistibly of a half-tamed falcon
on a perch.</p>

<p>I guessed this must be Jakoub, who had sat
next us in the boat, but whom I could not be said
to have seen, and to whom I had not yet spoken.</p>

<p>“Sa’ida Effendi,” he said gravely as I approached
him. He made his dignified salaam, touching his
forehead, lips and breast with a gesture that
surprised me, for it was so like the Christian ceremony
of crossing one’s self.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[95]</span>“Good morning,” I said; “do you speak English?”</p>

<p>“I speak all the languages. They are alike to
me.”</p>

<p>“You are—er—Jakoub?”</p>

<p>I knew no other name for him, but I was honestly
afraid of being unduly familiar in addressing him
by his—whatever the Mohammedan equivalent of
a Christian name may be.</p>

<p>“I am your Excellency’s servant—Jakoub,” he
replied.</p>

<p>He seemed to wait for me to continue the conversation
if I wanted to; but would evidently be
quite unembarrassed if no more were said. I
uttered the usual futility about the morning.</p>

<p>“It is, sir, ver’ beautiful,” he replied. “Your
English sea can be sometimes beautiful, but it is
not so often.”</p>

<p>He politely offered me the wheel, asking if I
would like to steer. I took it from him. Being
better used to a tiller, I did not at first find my
touch, and allowed a following sea to break square
on our counter. A heavy dash of spray wetted
us both, but Jakoub only smiled politely at my
vexation.</p>

<p>It was then that I began to hate him. His manner
was polite, in fact obsequious, but from the beginning
of our acquaintance I felt that he regarded me
as a sort of joke, as something utterly negligible.
In the covert insolence of his handsome face I
thought I read too that were I ever in his way he
would see me thrown overboard as if I were a rat.</p>

<p>I wondered at Edmund’s easy-going toleration
of such a man.</p>

<p>This was, however, my only disagreeable impression
on board the <i>Astarte</i> and, as I had no occasion<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[96]</span>
to see the man, it soon passed from my mind as I
fell into the mood of the cheerfully passing hours
aboard ship.</p>

<p>The weather kept fine, and the breeze held
throughout the day and the night.</p>

<p>Intent on picking up a little colloquial Arabic,
I spent a good deal of time talking to the Arab
who acted as waiter and servant in the saloon.
Although I had never before heard the language
spoken, I had in the course of my researches gained
some little acquaintance with the terrors of Arabic
grammar, and even some vocabulary, which I
now found I pronounced all wrong.</p>

<p>It was a relief to find that the extraordinary
complexities of the language, as written by scholars,
disappeared from the tongue as spoken, and I
hoped it would not be impossible to compass a
passable imitation of their weird gutturals and deep
chest tones.</p>

<p>Hassan, as our servant was called, professed to
be astonished at my proficiency, and I was encouraged
by finding that I could soon pick out some
words and phrases in listening to the jabber of the
Arab crew.</p>

<p>Edmund was often able to help me in points I
could not well explain to Hassan, although he
averred he only knew enough of the language “to
curse the niggers in.”</p>

<p>To Captain Welfare my progress was miraculous.
He said that to have been able to speak and understand
the language would once have been worth
a thousand pounds to him, but he had been told
it was derived from camel-talk, and had not believed
it was possible for a Christian to learn it.</p>

<p>He had all the ignorant Englishman’s feeling
that there is something undignified in using any<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[97]</span>
language spoken by what he calls generically
“natives,” which is curiously mingled with profound
respect for anyone else who can do it.</p>

<p>It was on our second morning out that I found
Captain Welfare on deck before me.</p>

<p>“That’s Alderney,” he said, pointing to a long
low coast-line just visible on our port bow.</p>

<p>“Already?” I asked. “We seem hardly to have
started.”</p>

<p>“I’m glad it’s not been tedious, sir. But we’re
a good way from Guernsey yet. The wind’s inclined
to south a bit though, and if it goes a few
more points we’ll get our square sails set again.
Then if it holds we’ll be there or thereabouts to-night
or to-morrow morning.”</p>

<p>“Well, I’m in no hurry to get there, as I said.”</p>

<p>“That’s maybe just as well. You never know
your luck at sea in a sailing boat.”</p>

<p>By midday I was watching the sea break over
the famous Casquets, which looked like the jaw of
a dog in the water. We went down to luncheon,
and were just having our coffee after the meal when
the saloon door opened and Jakoub came in.</p>

<p>This was an unwarranted intrusion, for Jakoub
had neither the status of a guest nor a servant,
and etiquette is necessarily rigid at sea. I saw
Welfare flush angrily and look at him with astonishment
in his round bright eyes.</p>

<p>“What the devil——?” began Edmund.</p>

<p>Jakoub looked at him quite impassively and said a
few words in Arabic which I did not understand.</p>

<p>I saw Edmund look startled.</p>

<p>“Get away on deck and I’ll follow you in a
minute,” he said.</p>

<p>Jakoub gravely salaamed and left, carefully
closing the door.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[98]</span>“What’s the matter?” asked Welfare.</p>

<p>“I’m just going to see. Nothing much, I expect,”
Edmund replied, but I thought there was a note
of anxiety in his voice.</p>

<p>“Infernal cheek of him walking in here, whatever
it is,” grumbled Welfare.</p>

<p>“Yes, of course,” Edmund agreed. “He should
have given his message to Hassan.”</p>

<p>I was enjoying the situation, taking the cowardly
pleasure that one does when a man one dislikes
incurs the blame of people one suspects of supporting
him. I had felt I was in a minority in
my resentment of Jakoub, and now I tasted the
craven joy of having others on my side.</p>

<p>“Excuse me,” said Edmund as he finished his
coffee, and he went on deck.</p>

<p>“I hope there’s nothing wrong?” I said to
Welfare.</p>

<p>“Oh, there can’t be anything <i>wrong</i> exactly. A
bit of a scrap among some of the crew, I daresay.”</p>

<p>In spite of his words he looked uneasy as he lit
a cigarette.</p>

<p>“Don’t let me keep you if you want to go up,”
I said.</p>

<p>“Perhaps I might as well have a look.” He
followed Edmund and I was left alone.</p>

<p>There were no unusual sounds, nor any sign of
alteration in the weather. I felt that if it was
only some matter of the ship’s discipline they
would prefer me to remain below.</p>

<p>I drank another cup of coffee, but then curiosity
overcame my scruples and I went on deck.</p>

<p>A little dirty steamer had come up to within a
quarter of a mile of us, one of those tiny nondescript
things that knock about near harbours with a bit
of deck for’ard and a funnel right in the stern<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[99]</span>
making a vast amount of black smoke. Someone
on her deck was handing down a string of signal-flags
as I came up, and I noticed that our course
was altered so as to bring us right down to her.
There was nothing else to be seen save the spouts
of foam over the Casquets, now far astern.</p>

<p>Captain Welfare, Edmund and Jakoub were
leaning on the port bulwarks, watching the little
vessel and then Edmund came past me to take
the wheel from one of the Arabs.</p>

<p>“What’s up?” I asked.</p>

<p>“It’s a letter from the people in Guernsey—I
don’t know what they want.”</p>

<p>The wheel was put over a few spokes, the crew
paid out some of the main and fore-sheets, and the
<i>Astarte</i> went foaming down widely to leeward of
the steamer.</p>

<p>I heard the “cling-cling” of the steamer’s engine
signal, and her noisy propeller stopped.</p>

<p>Then our wheel was put hard over, the big
booms came aboard with a swing, and the <i>Astarte</i>
came into the wind with a tremendous flapping
of her head-sails. Her way took her within a few
yards of the steamer, and as the helm was put over
again she slid slowly along her lee.</p>

<p>A man on the dirty little bridge gave us a hail
and swung out a small packet attached to a light line
which was neatly caught by Jakoub.</p>

<p>“All right?” he hailed in English.</p>

<p>“All right.”</p>

<p>The steamer’s skipper rang his engines on again,
the <i>Astarte</i> gathered her way, and the two boats
parted with a wave of the hand from the man on
the bridge.</p>

<p>I saw Captain Welfare cut the canvas wrappings
from the packet that had been thrown aboard.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[100]</span>
He took a letter out, opened it, and glanced at
it swiftly.</p>

<p>Then it seemed to me that he looked across the
deck at myself with an expression of regretful
perplexity on his great heavy face.</p>

<p>It occurred to me that this was how he would
look if he had to announce to me that someone
very dear to me were dead.</p>

<p>But at the same time I knew I was the one member
of the party who could not be affected by the
news, whatever it might be.</p>

<p>Still holding his letter in both hands and glancing
at it, Captain Welfare walked across to Edmund
and spoke to him.</p>

<p>Edmund nodded, called Jakoub, and handed over
the wheel to him. Then they both disappeared
down the companion.</p>

<p>I set down all these details as minutely as I
can remember them, because it is from them that
I have since had to piece together in my mind all
that was happening during this time when I had
no clue to their meaning.</p>

<p>I had no mind to speak to Jakoub, and stood
leaning over the bulwark watching the lessening
smudge of black smoke that represented the little
steamer.</p>

<p>Edmund had left us sailing with free sheets
on our course to Guernsey, so I was surprised on
looking up to see the crew getting in sheets, while
Jakoub put us on a course close-hauled to windward.</p>

<p>I surprised a look in Jakoub’s face as though
he were waiting for some sign of uneasiness on
my part. His face was more than usually insolent,
I thought, so I merely looked up along the leech
of the sail till the tremor died from it as the <i>Astarte</i><span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[101]</span>
settled to her new work. Then I returned to my
former posture and waited ten minutes by my
watch before I went below.</p>

<p>The saloon was empty, but I heard voices from
Welfare’s cabin, which had room for a good-sized
table in it, and served as a kind of office and chart-room.</p>

<p>I lay down on one of our delightfully comfortable
locker couches with a novel I had been trying to
get interested in. The steady motion of the boat
and the soft diffused light that came down from
the skylight were very soothing.</p>

<p>The book was one that Captain Welfare regarded
as a masterpiece of literature. He would not be
satisfied until I had read and praised it. I was
conscientiously trying to do the former, and intended
afterwards to praise it without consulting my
conscience. It was one of those novels that people
write again and again, like the pictures that turn
up season after season at the Academy—“Nymphs
Bathing,” “Autumn’s Fiery Finger,” and the
like. I forget whether this book was about Cavaliers
and Roundheads, or the French Revolution.
But very soon I began to be interested in the
patterns made by the spaces between the printed
words; they seemed to run in wavy lines down
the page, and soon the book had lost all power
to bore me. Presently I heard the cabin-door
open, and Edmund and Welfare came out, speaking
in low tones.</p>

<p>“You’ll have to tell him,” Edmund was saying.</p>

<p>“But what am I to say?”</p>

<p>“Stick to what we arranged. You must chalk
it all down to Jakoub.”</p>

<p>I perceived from their voices that they thought
I was asleep, and though their conversation had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[102]</span>
conveyed no meaning to me, I did not want to
overhear more. I coughed and sat up.</p>

<p>“I hope we have not disturbed you?” Welfare
asked, looking, I thought, a little guilty.</p>

<p>“Not at all. But I’m afraid I have dozed a
little over this most interesting book. It’s the
sea air, and the motion.”</p>

<p>“Quite so, quite so,” said Captain Welfare
solemnly.</p>

<p>Edmund said nothing and went on deck.</p>

<p>Captain Welfare sat down facing me in one
of the revolving chairs on the opposite side of the
table.</p>

<p>His eyes looked distressful in the midst of his
great cicatrix of a face, and I noticed perspiration
on his forehead and upper lip.</p>

<p>“I hope there’s nothing wrong?” I said.</p>

<p>“Well, we’ve had some rather upsetting news.
Nothing wrong exactly, but upsetting. It alters
our plans a bit. I was just going to tell you.
Me and Mr. Edmund have been talking things
over a bit.”</p>

<p>His big right hand was pinching up creases in
the table-cloth and setting it all crooked in a maddening
way.</p>

<p>“Well?” I said interrogatively.</p>

<p>“I don’t often drink between meals, Mr. Davoren,
but I think I’ll have a brandy and soda if you don’t
mind.”</p>

<p>“Of course,” I said, as he touched the gong
on the table and gave his instructions to Hassan.</p>

<p>“Perhaps you’ll join me?” he asked hopefully.</p>

<p>I elected to have some whisky, so as to put him
a little more at his ease, for he was perturbed to
an extent that was quite distressing.</p>

<p>I anticipated nothing but some trouble, possibly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[103]</span>
some loss, in connection with the business, and
was chiefly anxious to know whether Jakoub had
been authorised to alter our course.</p>

<p>Captain Welfare swallowed about half of his
brandy and soda and mopped his forehead, still
regarding me with a look of perplexity and distress.</p>

<p>“Yes,” he said, as though continuing a conversation.
“Yes. We’ll have to give Guernsey a
miss.”</p>

<p>“Oh! Are you going straight to Jersey, then?”</p>

<p>In the back of my mind I knew that the course
we were on was taking us away from the one island
as fast as from the other; but I had not thought
it out, and felt there must be some way of accounting
for the manœuvre.</p>

<p>“No. I’m afraid we’ll have to give Jersey a
miss too. In fact, we’ll have to cut out the islands
altogether this trip.”</p>

<p>“Really? That’s very disappointing. Are we
going straight back?”</p>

<p>“Oh no. No, we’ll not go back for a bit.”</p>

<p>“Well, where on earth <i>are</i> we going, Captain
Welfare?”</p>

<p>Captain Welfare slowly finished his drink and
looked as if he were pondering the advisability of
taking another. He finally put his glass down
a little tremulously.</p>

<p>“The fact is—you saw this message come
aboard?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Well, it seems we’re wanted out East at once,
very urgent. There’s nothing for it but to make
all sail and get there.”</p>

<p>“Out East?”</p>

<p>“The Mediterranean, you know—the old beat.”</p>

<p>“But that will take weeks!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[104]</span>“We should do it in a month with luck, if the
weather holds.”</p>

<p>“And where are you going to put me off?”</p>

<p>“We were just talking about that, me and
Mr. Edmund. You wouldn’t think well of making
the trip with us, I suppose?”</p>

<p>“That’s quite out of the question. I only
arranged to be away for two or three weeks.”</p>

<p>“It will be a bit warm out there, of course, but
not bad really, especially at sea, and the worst
of the Khamsins—that’s the hot winds, you know—will
be over.”</p>

<p>“But, Captain Welfare, I don’t care about the
climate there, for I’m not going. It’s impossible.
I must ask you to call at Guernsey or somewhere
and put me off. Then I could get back to Southampton.
I shall be very sorry to leave the boat,
but there’s nothing else for it.”</p>

<p>“It’s the time, Mr. Davoren. It might mean
missing our markets. We can’t afford to take
any chances.”</p>

<p>“I don’t profess to know much about trade——”</p>

<p>“You don’t, sir. You don’t know anything
about it. That’s what makes it so hard to explain.”</p>

<p>“All the same, I don’t see how a delay of twenty-four
hours or less in a month’s voyage is going to
make such a vital difference as all that.”</p>

<p>“That’s just it, Mr. Davoren. You don’t see
it. You can’t.”</p>

<p>“No, and therefore I demand to be landed at
Guernsey. After all, I’m a partner.”</p>

<p>“To be sure, sir. Nobody questions your right.
But we—well, the fact is we can’t call at Guernsey.
It’s not only missing our market—but we should
lose Jakoub.”</p>

<p>“Jakoub? That would be no great loss, in my<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[105]</span>
opinion. But what has he got to do with it?”</p>

<p>“I’m afraid Jakoub hasn’t a very good record.
We knew that, of course, when we took him on.
I think Mr. Edmund told you?”</p>

<p>“He did. And my own impression is that he’s
the biggest scoundrel unhung.”</p>

<p>“I wouldn’t be a bit surprised. But he’s extraordinarily
useful to us just at present. I don’t
know what we should do without him. Then
they would want us to give evidence, and you don’t
know what the Egyptian courts are for delay—and
worse things.”</p>

<p>“But what is it all about? For the Lord’s
sake, man, tell me straight what’s happened.”</p>

<p>“I was just going to. It seems he’s wanted
by the Egyptian police, and they have traced him
on to the <i>Astarte</i>, and have warrants out for him
all over the place. They might put the ship under
arrest, and that would simply ruin us. We’ve
got to get him back to Egypt, sir. We can get
rid of him there, and we cannot get rid of him
any nearer home.”</p>

<p>There was an air of finality in his tone which
warned me I must try to preserve my dignity,
even if bereft of my liberty.</p>

<p>“I think this is a matter that ought to be discussed
between all three of us,” I said. “Do
you mind if I send Hassan to ask my brother to
join us?”</p>

<p>“Not at all. I’ll go myself,” said Welfare
with an air of intense relief.</p>

<p>For the time being the thought uppermost in
my mind was the anxiety of Bates and Mrs. Rattray
at my absence. I had not been long enough away,
nor far enough, for the home foreground to recede.</p>

<p>Edmund came in, looking, to my surprise, more<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[106]</span>
cheerful and jollier than he had done for a long
time.</p>

<p>“Well,” he said, “I suppose Welfare’s broken
it to you? Ah! I see you’ve been drinking to
the cruise! I’ll join you. Hassan, get another
glass. I’m really jolly glad, old man, you’re coming.
You will simply love the Mediterranean.”</p>

<p>“It seems to me,” I said, with a sincere attempt
at austerity, “that I am being taken to the Mediterranean
against my will, in order to help a criminal
to elude justice.”</p>

<p>“Only temporarily,” said Edmund; “nothing
could keep Jakoub from the gallows in the long
run.”</p>

<p>“This kind of thing may be all very well for you.
But in my position——”</p>

<p>“I know. It wouldn’t be considered good form
in a clergyman. But I assure you nothing will
ever come of it—at home. We’re not going ‘East
of Suez, where there ain’t no ten commandments,’
but to Egypt and the Levant, where there are
so many commandments that nobody can remember
them all, or bother very much. Besides, you’ve
no responsibility in the matter, anyhow.”</p>

<p>“You forget I’m part owner of this boat.”</p>

<p>“We’ll make that all right. We’ll sign a declaration
that you have been shanghaied and brought
along under protest. You’ll sign, Welfare?”</p>

<p>“Certainly, if Mr. Davoren thinks it necessary.”</p>

<p>“I don’t want anything of the sort. But you
must see it is impossible for me to be so long away
from the parish.”</p>

<p>“Why, we heard the bishop telling you to stop
away as long as you liked; and it will be a godsend
for that poor fellow Snape.”</p>

<p>“Oh! he won’t object, I know. But Bates and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[107]</span>
Mrs. Rattray will be frantic with anxiety—and all
my letters unanswered!”</p>

<p>“We don’t suppose it’s convenient; but on
the other hand there’s the chance of making a
clear two thousand. Welfare and I can’t afford
to risk losing that.”</p>

<p>“Two thousand pounds? I wish you had let
me go back to Guernsey in the boat that brought
the message.”</p>

<p>“I never thought of that,” said Captain Welfare.</p>

<p>“Naturally. We didn’t know what the message
was. It wouldn’t have done, anyhow. No, it’s
far better as it is. The only thing now is to have
as good a time as we can. So here’s luck!”</p>

<p>“And I hope you won’t feel as if any constraint
was put on you, sir,” said Captain Welfare with
profound solemnity.</p>

<p>Edmund and I both laughed, and in the laugh
was my capitulation.</p>

<p>“I can’t feel that, Captain Welfare, as long as
you do nothing to prevent me swimming home!”</p>

<p>Captain Welfare held out his hand, and took
mine gravely.</p>

<p>“Mr. Davoren,” he said, “I wouldn’t have
had this happen for a great deal. I don’t know
how to thank you for taking it as you do, sir; it’s
a great relief.”</p>

<p>“That’s all right,” said Edmund; “and now we’ll
drink prosperity to the trip, and may nothing cheat
the gallows of Jakoub.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VI<br>

<small>A PLAN TO SAVE JAKOUB</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap2">AS I have said, I used to keep a careful
diary as long as my life contained nothing
eventful to record.</p>

<p>As soon as things began to happen to me I naturally
ceased to record them. I was too busy experiencing
them.</p>

<p>The diary habit, I think, presupposes a certain
placidity, both of mind and circumstance.</p>

<p>The days that followed each other now on board
the <i>Astarte</i> were placid enough, but the habit
was broken, and I have only a rather confused
memory of the long journey.</p>

<p>The wind held from the north and nor’-west,
steady and moderate, with bright skies, and the
<i>Astarte</i>, with the big square sails set, marched
steadily over the waters.</p>

<p>One night, as Edmund and I were on the deck
before turning in, a great light flashed on our
port bow. There was a slight haze, and we could
see the great white beam move round across sea
and sky like the hand of a vast clock until it struck
the <i>Astarte</i>, and seemed to pause for an instant
searching and almost blinding us ere it moved
away again on its night-long quest.</p>

<p>“That’s Ushant,” said Edmund. “We’ll soon
be in the Bay now.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[109]</span>For days and nights we were borne along on great
following seas that seemed to fling us from one
to another. Running before it we felt nothing of
the wind that hummed continually in the shrouds,
and it was as though we were swept down the current
of a mighty river.</p>

<p>Each day Edmund marked our position on the
chart, and declared happily that we had beaten
all records for a vessel of our size.</p>

<p>Home and all my little anxieties about it vanished
from my mind. Even the existence of Jakoub
ceased to trouble me.</p>

<p>I lived absorbed in the splendour of our motion
and in the rising and setting of the sun.</p>

<p>Then the sea became smoother, though the
good wind held, as the land came out to meet
us.</p>

<p>For whole days, it seems, I watched the dry,
greenish-brown foothills of the Portuguese coast,
with white farms and villages embedded in the
valleys, and the fantastic outline of the higher
land behind them.</p>

<p>We passed fleets of sardine-fishers in boats that
seemed to be absurdly small to be so far from
land, and for a whole day we were among a school
of dolphins that raced and played around us.</p>

<p>Until I had seen those creatures I always thought
a flock of swifts, screaming round the roofs in
the evening, were the highest expression in nature
of speed and delirious joy in life. But now I
long to be a dolphin when I die. As they tore
past us in groups and couples on the surface of
the water, now leaping clear, now diving deep
in a common impulse, one expected to hear great
shouts of laughter from them in their play. Yet
I was told there are men who shoot them and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[110]</span>
leave a useless, bloody carcass wallowing in their
vessel’s wake.</p>

<p>One evening it fell almost calm, with a deep-red
sunset touching the sea to flashes of rose among
its blue, and lighting the coast with a purple and
orange glow.</p>

<p>One of the Arabs in the fo’c’sle was singing,
or rather chanting, in a high-pitched tenor, and
at the end of each sentence his hearers chimed
in with a deep chorus of “Kham leila, kha-am
yome?” (“How many nights, how many days?”)</p>

<p>There was a strange mysterious melody in the
monotonous chant which was afterwards to become
so familiar. It fixed the whole strange sunset
landscape like a dream picture in my mind.</p>

<p>Jakoub came out cursing them. The weird
Oriental music ceased, and hatred of Jakoub
sprouted anew in my heart.</p>

<p>During all this time we were a cheery, cordial
party in the cabin. Edmund seemed to be continually
in high spirits as we got farther south
and the <i>Astarte</i> continued her record-breaking,
and every day I found Captain Welfare more
likeable as I got to know him better. He had
quite stopped apologising to me for things, and
had become used to treating me as a man of like
passions with himself. He was very interested in
the bishop, not having, as he said, met one before.</p>

<p>One day he asked me in strict confidence if I
thought his Lordship was really a God-fearing
man. I naturally found this a delicate question,
and one very difficult to answer.</p>

<p>“I should be very sorry to misrepresent him,”
I replied cautiously, “but I should take him to
be a man who feels he has no need to fear God.
After all, why should he?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[111]</span>Captain Welfare looked at me with as much
horror as though I had said something blasphemous.</p>

<p>“No need to fear God!” he replied. “Well,
I don’t know!”</p>

<p>I saw that if fear, craven fear of a petulant and
unreasonable Deity were deleted from his religion,
there would be nothing left.</p>

<p>For Welfare was a very simple, literal-minded
man. He was one of those who meant “fearing
God” when he said it. The words did not
convey to him their usual meaning of being bored
on Sunday; a commoner and, after all, a much
less harmful form of superstition.</p>

<p>I was glad he was shocked, because Ju-ju
worship makes me angry, and, unlike the bishop,
I am not much interested in the theological ideas
of primitive people. I never could see that these
ideas had any influence on their conduct. So I
was relieved to feel that Captain Welfare would
probably not want me to talk about religion any
more.</p>

<p>In the intervals between eating and sleeping—the
main concerns of a passenger on board ship—I
made very material progress in Arabic as
expounded by Hassan, and, spending thus a good
deal of time in the saloon, I noticed that Captain
Welfare was very busy in his cabin. He seemed to
spend hours a day writing in a number of large
strongly-bound commercial books of the type I was
accustomed to think of as “ledgers.”</p>

<p>One day he came to me with an air of great satisfaction
on his large countenance, as though he
were going to give me an unexpected treat.</p>

<p>“I’ve been thinking, sir,” he said, “that now
as you’re a partner you ought to have a thorough
overhaul of the books. So I’ve got ’em all up to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[112]</span>
date and summarised, and ready for your inspection,
whenever you feel inclined to take an hour or
two at them.”</p>

<p>“I’m afraid it would not be the slightest use,”
I said, determined to take a firm stand at the
beginning. A great disappointment clouded his
expression, and I thought of the hours I had seen
him spending over his lamentable occupation.</p>

<p>“You see,” I continued, as kindly as I could,
“I should not understand them. To me your
volumes are simply what Charles Lamb called
‘books that are no books.’ I have sometimes
tried to read the balance-sheets published by
charities to which I am a subscriber, and I always
find that everything that would normally be regarded
as an asset is placed on the debit side of the account;
while debts and other liabilities are on the credit
side, as if they were something to be proud of. I
have tried, but I cannot understand this. There is
either some perversity in the business mind, or
some blind spot in mine, which prevents our ever
coming together, as it were. I have definitely
abandoned all idea of trying to grasp what seems
to me to be rather absurdly called ‘book-keeping.’”</p>

<p>Captain Welfare tried several times to interrupt
this long speech; but I was determined to make
my position perfectly clear at the start and would
not let him.</p>

<p>He looked very disappointed.</p>

<p>“I know what you mean,” he said. “I don’t
mind admitting that sometimes those fancy ways
of accounting lays me over myself. But I’ve
got my own method—perfectly clear and—and
straightfor’ard. You’ll soon pick it up. Just
let me show you the ‘profit and loss’ account.”</p>

<p>He looked so pathetic, so like a child when<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[113]</span>
one has not time to take an interest in his toy,
that I yielded with a sigh and went into his cabin.</p>

<p>He had a great array of large folios. I admired
the binding and the smooth thick paper. I praised
the neatness of his handwriting and figures, and
particularly admired the diagonal lines which
he had ruled in red ink across half-blank pages.
These guided the eye down to the words “Total”
or “Brought forward,” followed by certain pounds,
shillings, and pence.</p>

<p>I told him that I had never been able to rule a
line with a pen without the ink forming little
pools along the ruler, which made blots when
you removed it.</p>

<p>I asked him to show me how to do it properly.</p>

<p>But it was no mere manual dexterity of which
Captain Welfare was proud. I had to tell him
regretfully that his figures conveyed almost nothing
to me, although I admitted that they appeared
to be based on something more like a rational
system than the usual products of professional
accountancy.</p>

<p>“Besides,” I said, as a cheering thought struck
me, “if I want to I can get an accountant to go
through all these books and report on them. I
might be able to understand his report.”</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” said Welfare doubtfully, “but
what I could explain these books better to you
than what I could to one of them professional
gentlemen. You see, they want things shown
by their own method, which ain’t applicable to
our business, as you say yourself. And they want
vouchers which you can’t get in our business.”</p>

<p>“Vouchers? Oh no, of course not!”</p>

<p>Whatever vouchers might be, I felt I should
greatly dislike them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[114]</span>“I’m glad you feel yourself we hadn’t ought
to produce vouchers. How can you get a receipt
from a native what can’t write his own language,
let alone any proper one?”</p>

<p>“No, that’s obvious,” I agreed.</p>

<p>“Well, I just wanted you as a partner to feel
you had access to everything, and to know you
were perfectly satisfied. Now this,” he added,
turning up a page in a smaller book, “this is an
idea of my own. Just to show you we are running
everything on sound business lines. This is the
Depreciation Account on the <i>Astarte</i>.”</p>

<p>“Oh!” I said, trying hard to make the monosyllable
sound intelligent and interested.</p>

<p>“Yes; every year we write so much off her
value. In a few years’ time she’ll be depreciated
away to nothing.”</p>

<p>“Oh! I hope not,” I said in alarm at the idea
of a few gaunt ribs representing all that was left
of the good ship.</p>

<p>“Hope not?” asked Welfare. “But don’t
you see that every penny we make out of her then
will be pure bunce?”</p>

<p>“Is that what they call ‘scrap price’?” I
asked.</p>

<p>I saw at once that I had said the wrong thing.</p>

<p>“Scrap price? Why, we’re not going to sell her!”</p>

<p>“Oh no. Of course not. Yes, of course, it’s a
splendid idea. I don’t quite see where the extra
money comes from. Wouldn’t it pay better to
keep her in repair?”</p>

<p>“Well, I don’t know! Of course, we keep her
in repair.”</p>

<p>“That’s all right then. I didn’t quite follow.”</p>

<p>“The point is, she stands at nothing in the
books.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[115]</span>“I see; and sticks at nothing on the sea, eh?”</p>

<p>I laughed at my own pleasantry, and was surprised
to see a look of quick suspicion and annoyance
on Captain Welfare’s usually genial face.</p>

<p>“Nothing in the way of weather, I mean.”</p>

<p>Captain Welfare closed his books in silence
and put them back on their shelf.</p>

<p>“Well, so long as you’re satisfied,” he said.</p>

<p>“Oh, I’m perfectly satisfied.”</p>

<p>“And the books is there for your inspection
whenever you’ve a mind.”</p>

<p>“Thank you. But I’m afraid you’ll have to
look upon me practically as a sleeping partner.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps it will be as well.”</p>

<p>I had lost count of the lapse of time under the
strange nepenthe-like influence that a sailing-ship
at sea possesses. If I thought at all of Bates
and Mrs. Rattray, of Snape or the bishop, of parish,
or pigeons, or the Byzantine Empire, it was as of
dead friends remembered, and dim interests of
the past.</p>

<p>The thought of anxiety on the part of people
at home no longer worried me. I had no worries.
I had hardly even anticipation. The <i>Astarte</i> had
become my planet, bearing all I knew of humanity.
The ocean had become space, through which my
planet ever moved, and measurements of time
had ceased to matter, as though we were already
in Eternity. I was content to lean for hours on the
bulwark looking down at the stream of bubbles
for ever forming on the ship’s side, begotten of
the sea by the ship’s motion, falling behind us,
spinning for a moment on the surface, and expiring
in their myriads, countless and insignificant as
human lives.</p>

<p>Then one day the horizon was decorated by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[116]</span>
the delicate white edges of the still snow-covered
Sierras of Spain. I do not know for how
many days I watched their delicate aerial loveliness.
We came nearer the land, and someone pointed
out Trafalgar Bay. But even that one magic
word was powerless to move me from the trance
that had got possession of my soul.</p>

<p>We passed through the Straits at night, and
I awoke in the Mediterranean.</p>

<p>We kept near the southern shore, passing under
the savage precipices and gullies of Ceuta. The
Rock of Gibraltar I saw only in the distance, standing
pointed like a helmet. The wind, still northerly,
was now on our beam, and there was less of it,
so that our progress, though still steady, was slower
than it had been.</p>

<p>For days and days it seemed we hugged the African
coast, sometimes so close that we could see the
stones and sand on the shingly beach below barren
rocky foothills. For the most part the land seemed
utterly uninhabited, but occasionally we passed
a greener tract, where there were sparse crops
and stunted bushes, occasionally a flat-roofed
hovel among them, and through Captain Welfare’s
telescope I could make out goats and children
moving.</p>

<p>It was strange to me to think of the lives of
human beings there.</p>

<p>On other days the land would recede quite out
of sight as we passed deep bays, and again we
passed islets of rock, precipitous and fantastic
in form and colour.</p>

<p>So desolate were these places, it seemed as if
ours must be the first eyes to see them, impossible
to realise that for ages men had known them,
charted, mapped and measured them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[117]</span>The only human incident I can recall in all this
time is that Edmund and Welfare quarrelled one
night over their game of piquet, and did not speak
to each other until after dinner the following evening,
when they resumed their play, and each politely
insisted that the other had been right. That is
one of the beauties of piquet. It can only be
rightly conducted in an atmosphere of eighteenth-century
courtliness. It is a game for ladies and
gentlemen, and soon, alas! will be played no more.
I was surprised to find that Welfare played it, and
could as soon have pictured him walking a minuet.</p>

<p>I was still dreamily content, and had ceased
to have even any curiosity as to our destination;
but as we drew nearer to the coast of Egypt I
noticed a new preoccupation in Edmund and
Welfare. They made long and intimate studies
of the chart, and several times I saw them in conversation
with Jakoub.</p>

<p>I began to awake with pain to the renewed sense
of the responsibilities and anxieties of life. I
had forgotten Jakoub, and to remember his existence
again brought back to me all the doubt and
fear of the future which is the real tragedy of
mankind.</p>

<p>I had seen the splendour of the Mediterranean
sky, the pageantry of dawn and sunset, of moonrise
and the evening star, as they might have
appeared to the first man; but now all was tarnished
again by human associations. I had to
put on life again as one might don a hair-shirt.
And I shrank from it.</p>

<p>Edmund began to hold aloof again, and some
instinct warned me that Welfare was seeking
in his clumsy mind for the easiest way of making
some difficult proposition.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[118]</span>I began almost unconsciously to arm myself
against him. So I was on the alert when he said
to me one afternoon with an elaborate attempt
to speak unconcernedly, “You’d like to see something
of the desert while you’re out here, I suppose?”</p>

<p>“I should have liked to see Egypt, of course,”
I replied, pre-warned, “but I can’t now. I shall
simply have to send a cable and get the first boat
for Marseilles.”</p>

<p>“To be sure. I know you must be getting home.
I shall be very sorry when you leave us, sir.”</p>

<p>“Thank you. I shall be quite as sorry to go.
It’s been a delightful trip. I feel as if I had been
dreaming. But I’ve woken up to reality now, and
I must make up my mind to a certain amount
of awkwardness after being so long away and sending
no word. I must get home and put things
straight.”</p>

<p>“That is so. I quite understand. I was thinking
you would actually save time, and see a bit
of the country into the bargain, if you landed
near the western frontier and went on overland to
Alexandria.”</p>

<p>“Is that possible?”</p>

<p>“Quite easy. It would be hot in the desert,
of course.”</p>

<p>“I don’t think I should mind the heat.”</p>

<p>“It would be about a day and a half’s camel
ride from the place I’m thinking of to the railway,
and then only a few hours to Alexandria. It would
take us longer by sea, even if the wind holds, and
it’s falling lighter. We’ll soon only have the
morning and evening breeze to count on.”</p>

<p>I found the idea of a camel ride across the desert
rather attractive. It would be an adventure,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[119]</span>
another instalment of the utterly unexpected, a
fitting end to this extraordinary voyage.</p>

<p>“You wouldn’t, of course, be seeing the Pyramids,
or the temples that everybody goes to see, but of
course you can visit them any time,” Captain Welfare
continued, as though impartially weighing
the advantages of his own suggestion, “and I
don’t fancy many tourists get to see the western
desert.”</p>

<p>“I should like it,” I said. “It would be intensely
interesting. But how on earth am I to get a
camel and a guide? I don’t suppose one can
whistle for them like a taxi?”</p>

<p>“No; it’s a pretty lonesome part. But Jakoub
will manage all that.”</p>

<p>“Jakoub?” I asked with instant suspicion.</p>

<p>“Yes; Jakoub has got to go that way.”</p>

<p>“Then he can go alone,” I said with sudden
emphasis. “I will not go with him.”</p>

<p>“No? I’m afraid that settles it then. It’s
a pity too, for I think you would have found it
interesting.”</p>

<p>Captain Welfare walked away as though the
subject were closed. If for any reason he wanted
me to go with Jakoub, this was the cleverest thing
I had known him do; for he left me longing to
discuss the matter. Indeed, I came to the conclusion
that he could not want me to go, for it
was difficult to credit him with so much subtlety.</p>

<p>I resumed the question myself at dinner, anxious
to know if Edmund had been consulted before
the proposal was made to me. Edmund made
no attempt to conceal the fact that it was their
joint idea.</p>

<p>“I don’t think,” he said, “that Welfare has
made it quite clear to you why we want you to go.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[120]</span>“I understood that it was to be a sort of pleasure
trip for me in charge of this malefactor of yours.”</p>

<p>“As a matter of fact, I think you would find
the journey interesting, though fatiguing. But
that is not the point.”</p>

<p>“My point is that I have no wish to be murdered
in a howling wilderness by a man of whom I utterly
disapprove.”</p>

<p>“Jakoub may be a murderer for all I know,”
Edmund admitted. “I am sure he would become
one if it suited his convenience. But you must
know that neither Welfare nor I would suggest
your going if there was the slightest chance of his
murdering you!”</p>

<p>Of course, I did know this perfectly well; but
with the babyish perversity that sometimes afflicts
quite sensible people, I felt compelled to go on
being offended. I was making myself ridiculous,
and I knew it, and nothing feeds anger in one’s
heart like that. But having once adopted a pose,
even a pose one dislikes or is tired of, it requires
immense strength of mind to abandon it.</p>

<p>I have known the happiness of families wrecked
by this fatuous adhesion to a worn-out, discredited
and detested pose.</p>

<p>“I don’t see,” I said, “what is to prevent his
murdering me if he wants to. I’m sure he dislikes
me as much as I do him.”</p>

<p>“Very likely. But under the circumstances
you will be necessary to his own safety. Jakoub
has sense enough to control his dislikes.”</p>

<p>“And in what way am I to protect him?”</p>

<p>“You’ll be part of his disguise. He’ll go as
your dragoman. It’s the only way to get him safely
into Alexandria, and we must have him there for
a few days to negotiate this sale.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[121]</span>“Why can’t you go yourself, or Captain Welfare?”</p>

<p>“I’m wanted to navigate the ship. Welfare
couldn’t manage the business, because he can’t
talk the lingo. And Jakoub must be got off the
ship before they come and look for him.”</p>

<p>“And why should I help the brute to escape?
I don’t want him to escape!”</p>

<p>“Mr. Davoren,” said Welfare very solemnly,
“Jakoub is a wrong ’un, I admit. A dead wrong
’un. I’ve never disguised my opinion about that.
I don’t know what the charges against him may
be—not all of them. But I know this, however
bad you may think him, if you saw the convict
prison at Tourah you wouldn’t want to help get
him there. If you saw the poor devils there working
in chains in the quarries under the desert sun,
you’d know that no man is bad enough for it. I
tell you, sir, if a convict’s friends have any money
when he’s sent there, they try to bribe a sentry
to shoot him. It’s all they can do. Men have
prayed their judges to hang them, sooner than
be sent there.”</p>

<p>This appeal of Captain Welfare’s impressed me,
but I only said, “All the same, I don’t see why
I should help him to escape the law. It’s a very
unpleasant, a very risky, a very wrong thing for
a man in my position to do.”</p>

<p>“But,” said Edmund, “you don’t know anything
against him really except what we’ve told you—our
suspicions.”</p>

<p>“You forget that you mentioned warrants for
his arrest.”</p>

<p>“Aye. We did mention that,” said Welfare;
“it’s a pity, but we had to.”</p>

<p>“Captain Welfare, am I to understand that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[122]</span>
you decide beforehand how much of the truth
I am to be told?”</p>

<p>“Oh, dear no, sir. You’ve been told practically
everything. I only meant that if we had kept
it quiet about the warrants you’d maybe have
been easier in your mind.”</p>

<p>“There’s no need for us to start disliking each
other,” Edmund remarked judicially; “the situation
is simply this. Jakoub must go. If you
don’t like to go with him he must go alone. In
that case he risks his own liberty and our profit.
If you choose, you can save both. I quite admit
it’s asking a good deal of you. But what you do
not know is Egypt and the ways of the Egyptian
police and their courts. Jakoub probably does
not deserve justice, but he certainly won’t get it
from them. He would probably get off scot free
simply because he really is a rogue. In the meantime,
I don’t see why he should not be serving us.”</p>

<p>“It seems to me that I am now being asked
to go practically on behalf of the firm. That is
a very different thing from having a sort of pleasure
trip arranged for my benefit.”</p>

<p>I spoke thus in loyalty to my pose, of which
I was getting sicker every moment. I had made
up my mind to go, since I had learned that Jakoub
had good reasons for letting me continue to live,
and that handing him over to Egyptian justice was
apparently patronising a kind of lottery, in which
he might draw a ticket entitling him to be tortured
to death, or a different-coloured one letting
him go free. I wanted to see him decently but
quite certainly hanged.</p>

<p>“I’m afraid I’m to blame,” said Captain Welfare.
“I hadn’t ought to have put it to you as I did.
I was going on to explain how you might give us all<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[123]</span>
a leg-up, all of us as a firm I mean, but if you remember,
sir, you rayther cut me short about Jakoub.”</p>

<p>This was a very unnecessary remark of Captain
Welfare’s. It merely emphasised the personal
side of my present attitude, which I was now
anxious to abandon. Edmund’s delicate tact evidently
recognised this.</p>

<p>“I am certainly asking you to go on behalf of
the firm,” he said. “We must have someone
we can trust in charge of Jakoub, whom we cannot
trust. And at present there simply isn’t anyone
else but you.”</p>

<p>This, of course, settled it, and I had very soon
graciously promised to go.</p>

<p>On looking back it seems to me that in every one
of these transactions I allowed myself to become
as it were committed, without knowing the details,
or anything of the possible objections. When these
became obvious it was too late for me to withdraw.</p>

<p>I was, in fact, dragged at the heels of Edmund’s
fate. That is the only excuse I can offer to those
who, knowing the sequel, will judge that I require
one.</p>

<p>For myself I require no excuse, for I was not
conscious of wrong-doing. But then, I have already
tried to explain to the reader something of those
terms of pleasant familiarity on which I and my
conscience dwelt together. I am sure it should
be a function of any true religion to promote this
cheery co-partnership, and that if it were only
commoner there would be far more agreeable
people in the world. I always take at their word
those who go about calling themselves “miserable
sinners,” and I notice this always seems to disconcert
them.</p>

<p>We had been for some time out of sight of land,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[124]</span>
as the coast of Tripoli had fallen away from us
into the great Bay of Sidra, but now, on the morning
after our discussion, I saw for the first time the
edge of the great Libyan Desert.</p>

<p>We still carried a breeze with us, but inland of
us the sea lay becalmed, so smooth it seemed to
be some viscous sea like that imagined by the
Ancient Mariner, while the miraged atmosphere
above it was fluid. The remotest part of this
shimmering fluid was threaded by a thin line of
broken points of yellow light, like fragments of
the moon.</p>

<p>That was the distant coast, the margin of the
great desert.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[125]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VII<br>

<small>I MOUNT A CAMEL</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">BY the next morning the coast was more
distinct and we were still approaching
it. But our progress was now very slow,
and we could depend only on the land breeze
of early morning and the sea-breeze of the
evening.</p>

<p>The heat of the day was tremendous, or seemed
so to me even under the awnings which were
rigged fore and aft and kept constantly wet.
Metal-work on deck became too hot to touch,
and even the painted wooden bulwarks burned
through one’s sleeves when leaned upon.</p>

<p>The Arabs worked unwillingly, dropping down
and sleeping in any patch of shade that presented
itself, and I constantly heard the horrid swish
of Jakoub’s whip as he woke them. I spent the
long intolerable days dripping in a hammock
chair on deck, feverishly watching the sweep of
the sun across the sky and calculating the hours
to be endured before he would again become red
and harmless in the healing vapours of the western
horizon, and the sea-breeze would surprise me
again with its chilliness. Or I gazed with aching
eyes at the palpitating sand of the coast, wondering
if it would be possible for me to live and
move on it at all?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[126]</span>Edmund and Welfare had the acquired eastern
habit of sleeping during the hot hours, and spent
most of the time in their cabins, when they were
not required on deck.</p>

<p>At that blessed hour before sunset, however,
we met on deck, and Hassan brought up ingeniously
cooled drinks for the party.</p>

<p>It was on one of these occasions that I expressed
my fears as to the heat of the desert journey.</p>

<p>“It won’t be as bad as this, really,” Edmund
said. “We’ll land you in the evening when
Jakoub has got the camels together and loaded.
You’ll travel through the night and make for a
place where you can spend the day under shelter.
Then it will be only one trek of a few hours to
the nearest station on the railway. I’ve never
been on that Western Railway, but I’m afraid
they’re fairly rotten old carriages. If you get
a day-train it will be beastly hot and dusty. Five
or six hours will get you into Alexandria.”</p>

<p>“That certainly does not sound alarming.”</p>

<p>I had a twinge of something like disappointment
at the idea of my adventure dwindling to
such modest dimensions. Once it was over, I
should have liked to tell people at the Athenæum
and other comfortable places at home about “the
long trek on camel-back across the burning
sands.”</p>

<p>I would have welcomed quite a considerable
degree of real discomfort as a basis for exaggeration
within the limits proper to a clergyman.</p>

<p>“I shouldn’t mind trying a part of the journey
in the daytime,” I said.</p>

<p>“Perhaps not,” said Captain Welfare. “But
the natives won’t allow their camels to work in
the heat.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[127]</span>“I thought a camel could stand any amount
of heat!”</p>

<p>“Not them. They’re the softest beasts that
walk. They drop in their tracks in the heat,
and if it’s cold at night they have to be rugged
up better than a horse.”</p>

<p>“There is more rot believed by people at home
about camels,” said Edmund, “than about any
beast of the field. What do you suppose is a
camel’s load?”</p>

<p>“I confess my ideas are very vague. I couldn’t
tell you to a ton.”</p>

<p>They both laughed.</p>

<p>“I think it’s the natural history books that
are given as Sunday school prizes that are responsible
for the average Englishman’s ideas about
camels. Their proper load for regular work is
300 lbs. Of course they can take more for a
short time. The natives overload them badly
themselves, but they won’t let us when we hire
them. You bet they watch that. And he’s got
to be watered every second day to keep his condition—not
about once a week as people imagine.
As his pace is two-and-a-half miles an hour, a
horse can really get just as far between drinks.
All the same he’s a most invaluable beast. We
could do nothing without him on the desert. Oh,
you’ll get to like them all right when you’re used
to them.”</p>

<p>As a matter of fact, now that the time was
getting so near, I began to have qualms of uneasiness
at the idea of riding on one of these
uncouth beasts.</p>

<p>I like riding my own familiar cob, but am somewhat
nervous of mounting even a strange horse,
and to me a camel had never been anything but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[128]</span>
an object placed for my amusement and instruction
in the Zoological Garden. There he had
always amused and instructed me from the other
side of a tall and impregnable iron fence.</p>

<p>I knew of course that trippers in Egypt always
got photographed mounted on a camel with the
Sphinx and a Pyramid in the background, as
if all their tripping in Egypt were done on camel-back,
and they had not in fact gone from Cairo
to Ghizeh in an electric tramcar. But I now
reflected that these were doubtless special camels
kept for the purpose, broken, as it were, to trippers—heart-broken
no doubt!</p>

<p>But to have to mount and control the ordinary
camel of Arab commerce, picked up by Jakoub
on a wild and inaccessible part of the desert, I
felt, might be a very different proposition, and
one making a heavy demand on the courage of
a middle-aged and naturally timid vicar.</p>

<p>“I hope,” I said, “I shall be able to ride the
beast all right.”</p>

<p>“Oh! you’ll manage that easily,” Edmund
said. “They’re perfectly quiet. We’ll show you
how to mount, and after he gets up, you have
only to sit there and oscillate.”</p>

<p>It sounded quite simple, and yet there were
vague misgivings left in my heart.</p>

<p>“How many camels are we taking?” I asked.</p>

<p>“Well, we’ve roughly 2,000 lbs. of stuff. That
will take six baggage camels. Four could do
it for such a short journey, but the natives are
sure to insist on our hiring six. Then there’ll
be a riding camel for you and one for Jakoub.”</p>

<p>“By the way, what is this merchandise I am
shepherding?” I asked.</p>

<p>“We’ll have to explain all that,” said Edmund,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[129]</span>
cutting in as Welfare rubbed his great chin thoughtfully.
“We’ve got to give you a lot of rather
elaborate directions. I suppose we might as well
do it now as later.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” added Captain Welfare, “the whole
thing is a rather delicate business. If it’s not
worked right we’d spoil our own market, and
you see we can’t let Jakoub know too much.”</p>

<p>“I’m very glad to hear that,” I said.</p>

<p>“You must not tell him anything,” said Welfare,
“though he has to hand the stuff over to
our agent, and even that has to be done quietly.
The stuff is—well, it’s a kind of chemical. It’s
one of the rare earths used in making incandescent
gas-mantles. There’s hardly any of it in Egypt
and there’s tremendous competition to get it.
That’s why if it was known as we’d brought in
such a big lot as 2,000 lbs. the price would go
flop, and we’d lose a lot of money.”</p>

<p>“I see.” This really did seem to me an obvious
and easily comprehensible proposition.</p>

<p>“And so,” said Edmund, taking up the argument,
“we want you to take it into Alexandria
as curios, and specimens and things you have
collected in the desert. That is if you’re asked
any questions, which you probably won’t be.”</p>

<p>I could feel their eyes upon me as I took in
their suggestion that I should become a party
to what certainly seemed to me a transaction
very near akin to fraud. I was amused to feel
that they both expected me to be much more
shocked than in fact I was.</p>

<p>As long as I was satisfied that nobody was
going to be injured or defrauded, the mere “verbal
inexactitude” was to me only a harmless breach
of one of those conventions which, as I have already<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[130]</span>
explained, I regard as maintained for the guidance
of persons of inferior intellect.</p>

<p>This attitude of mind may seem rather shocking
to some quite intelligent people. I suppose
it represents the effect on me of my theological
training.</p>

<p>“Don’t you think,” I asked after a rather
pregnant pause, “that my position would be a
somewhat uncomfortable one if it were discovered
that my desert collections consisted entirely of
rare earth for incandescent mantles?”</p>

<p>“It would,” Edmund admitted, “but there’s
not the slightest risk of that happening. Do
you think I would ask you to do it if there were?”</p>

<p>“Honestly, Edmund, it is becoming difficult
for me to estimate the limits of your possible
requests.”</p>

<p>Edmund smiled gaily, with a look of relief,
but Captain Welfare still watched me, leaning
forward with his hairy hands on his knees and
an expression of anxious solicitude in his large
pathetic eyes.</p>

<p>“If you like, sir,” he suggested, “we could
easily put in a layer of shells, and fossils, and
native ornaments; things a clergyman <i>would</i> pick
up on the desert.”</p>

<p>“No, thank you,” I said snappishly.</p>

<p>“There’s not the remotest fear of anyone wanting
to examine the cases, or asking any questions,
as long as they’re under your charge. I merely
suggested you should yourself say they were your
collections, or whatever you like to call them,
when putting them on the railway. I’ve worked
it all out. Now, listen, we put you ashore at a
quiet spot on Egyptian territory. If the stuff
were dutiable, that would of course be smuggling.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[131]</span>
Certainly if we landed at Alexandria the Customs
people would examine it, and we have told you
why we don’t want it known that we have brought
the stuff into Egypt. The camel-men won’t
bother, as long as they’re paid about double the
proper price for their camels, and at the station,
for a hundred piastres backshish, you will have
both station-master and guard ready to shine
your boots with their tongues.</p>

<p>“At Alexandria you will go straight to Van
Ermengen’s hotel. He knows all about the consignment,
and Jakoub will follow you with the
cases as soon as he is able to get a vehicle to put
them in. Then you will hand them over to our
agent in Alexandria, who will call for them with
a note signed by us, which you will have posted
yourself in Alexandria. Then you will have
finished with the business, and Jakoub will get
back to us if he can, and go to the devil if he
can’t.”</p>

<p>As thus stated by Edmund, the proposition
seemed to me quite a harmless <i>ruse de guerre</i>.
I was suspicious of all commercial methods, and
nothing would have induced me for instance to
co-operate in anything like the trading habits
of our grocer, who was nevertheless, as I have
already mentioned, one of the most eminent members
of my Sunday congregation. But I saw
nothing in this transaction to which anyone could
object who kept his conscience in reasonable subjection,
and I said so frankly.</p>

<p>Captain Welfare’s tension immediately relaxed.
He leaned back in his chair with a sigh and wiped
his forehead and upper lip with his handkerchief.
As the evening was now cool, and no amount of
heat ever seemed able to make Captain Welfare<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[132]</span>
perspire, this was a sure indication that he had
been in a condition of considerable mental agitation.
He drew a long breath and I saw at once
that he was under the necessity of making a
speech. This happened to him sometimes, just
as other men get periodical attacks of asthma or
gall-stones.</p>

<p>“Mr. Davoren, sir,” he began, after clearing
his throat in the most approved oratorical style,
“I think this is the third time as we’ve had to
put before you a proposition that must have
seemed distasteful to you. A proposition you
might have been justified in refusing without
examination, if so be you had been a man as is
not prepared to look into things and do the square
thing, and the kind thing, and the generous
thing——”</p>

<p>“Oh, stow it, Welfare!” said Edmund.</p>

<p>But Captain Welfare was not to be stopped
now, any more than a body of stampeded mules.
He ignored Edmund, who stretched out his legs,
shut his eyes, and pretended to go to sleep.</p>

<p>“I want to put it on record, sir, as I appreciate—as
<i>we</i> appreciate the handsome way you have
met us on these occasions. You’ve acted as a
gentleman, sir, because you are a gentleman,
and as a man because—well—because you <i>are</i> a
man.”</p>

<p>There was a prolonged groan from Edmund.</p>

<p>“I wish to thank you, sir, for the spirit in which
you have met all our suggestions.”</p>

<p>I felt extremely embarrassed.</p>

<p>The <i>Astarte</i> lay becalmed and almost motionless
between the still glowing desert shore and
the vast disc of the sun, now falling through
a mass of slate-coloured vapour to his setting.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[133]</span>
In all this golden and purple immensity there
was no living thing in sight outside the ship,
which was suspended like a fragment of dust in
a sunbeam. The only human sound was Captain
Welfare’s egregious clap-trap.</p>

<p>He was talking away exactly as if he were moving
a vote of thanks to the chairman of a board
of guardians or a town council, or proposing a
toast at an Oddfellows’ supper. He was in that
state of orgasm which oratory of this type always
produces in the lower middle-class Englishman.</p>

<p>This habit is ridiculous enough, even among
its normal surroundings of stuffy rooms, half-cleared
tables, and black-coated pork-butchers
and pawnbrokers. But here, poised in the silence
where sea and sky and desert met, where Nature
seemed to have unveiled her immensity in a sacramental
moment, Captain Welfare ceased to be
absurd.</p>

<p>Edmund and I both felt him as something
almost obscene—a sacrilege.</p>

<p>I managed to murmur, “Thank you,” when
he finished, and I was indeed thankful for silence
when it came.</p>

<p>But grateful as the silence was, it seemed necessary
to say something, if only to prevent the discovery
by Welfare that he had not the sympathy
of his audience, and so the development among
us of embarrassment and discomfort.</p>

<p>I asked him how long he thought it would be
before we reached the landing-place.</p>

<p>“We’re close to it now,” he said, “not above
thirty miles or so, but of course we’re at the mercy
of the wind and the current.”</p>

<p>“The current?” I asked. “I thought there
was practically no tide in the Mediterranean.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[134]</span>“No, there’s no tide to speak of. But coastal
currents? My word! You pick up a point
ashore, and see how we’re drifting now.”</p>

<p>Distant as the coast was, I could see that we
were indeed slipping slowly back on the way we
had come.</p>

<p>“The worst of these currents is that you can’t
reckon on them like the tide. They’re wind-driven,
or caused by heat, I suppose, but when
you’re ashore don’t you go bathing on this coast
without you know where you are. There’s often
a four-knot current inshore that would sweep
any man away, and often does. But if we get
a breeze to-night, we ought to land you to-morrow.”</p>

<p>As he spoke the last limb of the sun sank below
the horizon, lighting it for a moment with the
mysterious green flash that is sometimes seen
in these waters, and is said to be due to its rays
shining through and illuminating the water at
the edge of the sea.</p>

<p>At the same time the sea, which had looked
like a bath of mercury, suddenly blackened
to northward of us, and the <i>Astarte’s</i> booms
swung out to starboard with the cheery rattle
of sheets running through the blocks. The ship
leaned over with a little thrill as of a happy awakening,
the ripple began to play again at her bow,
and we were under way once more.</p>

<p>“That’s better,” said Captain Welfare, rising
from his chair. “Would you like to see just
where we are on the chart?”</p>

<p>I thanked him, and we all three went below
to his cabin.</p>

<p>A section of an Admiralty chart was pinned
out as usual, with the <i>Astarte’s</i> position from day
to day marked on it in pencil.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[135]</span>Captain Welfare put a broad forefinger close
to the last mark.</p>

<p>“That’s where we are now,” he said, “as near
as we can tell from soundings. As you see yourself,
there’s no land-marks anyone could pick up
hereabouts. Those figures show you it’s all shoal
water between us and the land, until we get
here.”</p>

<p>He indicated a place a little farther east along
the coast, where there was a small bay or indentation.</p>

<p>“Here you see there’s water enough for the
<i>Astarte</i> up to within a few yards of the beach,
and there’s some tall sandhills and a bit of an
old ruined sheikh’s tomb that we can pick up
even at night with this moon.”</p>

<p>“Yes; but are there any human beings or
camels there?”</p>

<p>Edmund laughed. “I think,” he said, “you
still suspect us of some ill doings. Do you really
think we are going to maroon you on a waterless
desert with a single cut-throat for companion?”</p>

<p>“Don’t be an ass, Edmund; but if you know
anything about the business, tell me how we’re
going to get camels here?”</p>

<p>“From the Arabs,” said Captain Welfare;
“there’s a tribe of them always in camp at this
time of year a little inland of where we’re going
to land you. At least so Jakoub says, and he
knows the district. They’ll be getting in their
barley crop now. They do some camel breeding
here too. Jakoub says he is sure to find them
here, because the calves will be still too young
to go on trek. You’ll see now, Mr. Davoren, how
we’re bound to depend on Jakoub in a business
like this is.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[136]</span>“I suppose it would be impossible,” I suggested,
“to find an Arab with Jakoub’s knowledge,
who was not also a scoundrel?”</p>

<p>“I don’t believe,” said Welfare solemnly, “that
such a man exists. A straight man couldn’t
know all Jakoub knows.”</p>

<p>This remark silenced me. I had so often myself
observed this inverse ratio between knowledge
and virtue.</p>

<p>At dinner that evening I was somewhat oppressed
by the feeling that it was probably my last night
on the <i>Astarte</i>. We had been such good friends
on board. The little cabin had come to look so
familiar and so homelike to me; the whole experience
had been so strange and withal so delightful
to me, that I could not but feel saddened at the
thought of leaving it all. Instinctively I shrank
a little from the unknown and solitary experiences
that awaited me in a strange land.</p>

<p>I knew too that I would be missed, if only
because three are much better company than
two—where men are concerned at all events.
Without conceit I knew I should be missed in
a much deeper sense than that. I am one of
those insignificant but cornerless people who make
a good third in such close quarters as ours were,
and I was conscious that Edmund and Captain
Welfare liked each other the better for my presence.</p>

<p>Captain Welfare openly expressed his regret
at my impending departure, and it required some
skilled manœuvring on the part of Edmund and
myself to head him away from another speech.</p>

<p>“By the way,” I said, “you have forgotten
to tell me what your plans are after you leave
me, and when we are to meet again?”</p>

<p>“Oh! we’ll pick you up in Alexandria in a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[137]</span>
few days,” said Edmund. “We’ll see you off
home, unless you make up your mind to continue
the cruise.”</p>

<p>“I wish that were possible,” I said regretfully;
“but it isn’t.”</p>

<p>“When we put you ashore, sir,” said Captain
Welfare, “we’ll get out to sea as best we can,
and get in the regular track of boats bound to
Alexandria. If the police are on the look-out
for Jakoub, they’ll board us either there or when
we’re signalled at the harbour. I only wish you
knew as much about the Gyppie police as we do,
and could enjoy the laugh same as we will.”</p>

<p>There was an unusual vindictiveness in Captain
Welfare’s tone that made me wonder for a moment
what were the experiences that had so prejudiced
him against this branch of the public service.</p>

<p>But this was not a time for uncharitable thoughts,
and I put this one aside.</p>

<p>“By the way,” Edmund said, “we’ll have
to look you out some clothes. I presume you
didn’t bring any tropical kit?”</p>

<p>“No,” I told him; “Bates fixed me up with
these blue serge things and several pairs of white
flannel trousers, most of which I am afraid I have
soiled. He has also included a complete clerical
rig-out, without which he never allows me to
travel.”</p>

<p>“Good!” said Edmund. “You have got some
dog-collars then? Bates is a pearl of great price.
That is the only thing that was worrying me.”</p>

<p>“He has packed some clerical collars and a
stock, if that’s what you mean.”</p>

<p>“What on earth is a stock?” Edmund asked.</p>

<p>“It is the black silk thing below what you
call a dog-collar. The two combined are the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[138]</span>
symbol of the Apostolic Succession. A stud,
or a button-hole in front, is a split—the stigma
of Schism. It is commonly associated with a
white tie, an arrogant assumption of individual
blamelessness only possible in a heretic.”</p>

<p>“Well now, that’s something I never understood
before,” said Captain Welfare. “You mean
a church parson isn’t better than another man,
or don’t reckon to be, outside of his official position?
Out of his uniform, eh?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know that I meant all that,” I said,
rather taken aback by this literal interpretation
of my frivolous talk. “I’m not much of a theologian,
but I think what you say is something
very like the Anglican idea.”</p>

<p>“Well, I like it,” he said; “I’ve known preachers
at home as has worn the biggest kind of white
ties, and it’s some of their ways as has stuck in
my gizzard and made me the back-slider I am.
Mr. Davoren, when I get ashore, I’d like to join
your church. I’d take it kindly if you’d baptise
me, sir.”</p>

<p>I said I should be delighted. I did not see
what else I could say under the circumstances,
although I have a rooted objection to proselytes
of every description.</p>

<p>“The question is,” said Edmund impatiently,
“whether Welfare’s drill kit or mine would fit
you best? We’ve both got plenty of clean spare
suits, and I can rig you up with a pith helmet.
I was only worried about the collar. You won’t
want one in the desert; but it’s rather important
you should turn up in Alexandria in clerical kit.”</p>

<p>“I can manage that all right,” I said indifferently.
“I suppose my own clothes would be
too warm?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[139]</span>“Much too warm. You couldn’t stand them.”</p>

<p>Edmund spoke decisively and I sighed, for I
dislike wearing clothes that have not been made
for me. Edmund is two inches taller than me,
and of late I have shown distinct signs of what
my father used to call “the elderly spread.” On
the other hand Captain Welfare, though about
my own height, is immensely larger in all his other
dimensions.</p>

<p>There is however, fortunately, a remarkable
flexibility about men’s clothes, and I was able
to pick out a couple of suits which I could wear
with comfort and without loss of self-respect.
Indeed I can say more than that. So persistent
is human vanity that I found myself admiring
my own appearance in the clean white drill. It
gave me, I thought, a look of youth and distinction
to which I imagined I had long since renounced
all claims.</p>

<p>Edmund caught me in front of the mirror deciding
on the most becoming tilt of the pith helmet.
This persistence of the peacock in one’s nature
is very disturbing.</p>

<p>I was woken very early in the morning by a
rattle which shook the whole ship. I started
up and realised that it was the anchor chain running
out. My long journey in the <i>Astarte</i> was
at an end.</p>

<p>I went straight on deck, and saw the desert
close to me for the first time.</p>

<p>The sun had not yet risen, but the dawn was
foretold by a lilac glow in the east where Venus
still shone illustrious as a morning star.</p>

<p>The <i>Astarte</i> was at anchor in a little cove,
evidently the one I had been shown on the chart,
for on my left I could see in the twilight the tall<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[140]</span>
sandhills mentioned by Welfare. They were
strangely carved by the wind to sharp, delicately
curved edges with a surpassing beauty of line.
Beside them on a lower level rose the little rounded
dome of the sheikh’s tomb, over which leaned
a single tall, crooked date palm. Away to the
right of this the sand stretched to the horizon
in wave after wave, yellow and silver in the faint
light, with violet shadows between the vast undulations,
and a few black patches of camel-scrub
here and there.</p>

<p>The wind had almost gone. It ruffled the sea
outside to a dark grey, but around us in the little
bay the water lay silent, polished and opalescent
under the growing dawn.</p>

<p>The dinghy was already being rowed ashore,
and I recognised Jakoub’s back, sitting crouched
like a bird of prey in the stern-sheets.</p>

<p>The crew were busy getting the sails off the
ship and stowing them. They worked quickly
and in a strange uncanny silence.</p>

<p>Edmund and Captain Welfare were both on
deck, already dressed. They stood together watching
the crew, and speaking almost in whispers
with an unwonted look of anxiety on their faces.
Captain Welfare kept searching the shore with
his telescope.</p>

<p>Very soon I saw the morning star fade out in
a red glare that filled the east, and then the sun
came up, climbing swiftly from the horizon. For
a moment the desert sparkled with the lustre
of jewellery; then the effect passed, and its surface
settled into the burning yellow and white
of the common light of day.</p>

<p>But the smooth shallow sea of the desert’s margin
turned from the pearly opalescence of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[141]</span>
dawn to a glory of blue such as I had never imagined.
It was not the blue of the sea or sky, but
the incredible blue of a butterfly’s wing. It
brought to my mind childhood’s dream-pictures
of the glory of the river that flows round the Throne
of God, and my heart ached with the splendour
of it.</p>

<p>The sun came as a tyrant. It seemed to take
but a few moments before he was clear of the
vapour of the horizon, and the heat of the day
had begun.</p>

<p>I went below to my cabin. I dressed myself,
and sorrowfully bestowed what I needed for my
journey in a hold-all.</p>

<p>The hot day seemed intolerably long. I lay
on deck trying in vain to read. Their manifest
anxiety kept Edmund and Welfare in an irritable
silence.</p>

<p>The cases I was to take with me were brought
on deck. They were roped and sealed, and the
word “Anticas” was painted on the outside in
large black letters, with some Arabic characters
below which I took to be a translation of this lie.</p>

<p>The boat was lowered and they were stowed
in it with my hold-all and all brought ashore and
laid on the beach. There was nothing more to
do, and by four o’clock our nervous tension was
becoming almost unbearable when the sandy
sky-line was broken by the tall silhouette of a
camel, with a man mounted on it, advancing
majestically towards us.</p>

<p>Captain Welfare had a long look at him through
the glass.</p>

<p>“Thank God!” he said. “It’s Jakoub all right.
The others must be following him.”</p>

<p>Jakoub put his camel into a trot and came<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[142]</span>
rapidly down to the beach. I watched with
anticipatory dread the process of making the
camel kneel, or as it seemed to me, fold itself up.
Jakoub sprang lightly off and tied the animal’s
nose-rope round one of its knees to secure it. The
camel stretched its long neck along the ground
and began nosing in the sand for something eatable.</p>

<p>Jakoub came out in the dinghy and was aboard
in a few minutes.</p>

<p>Captain Welfare met him, and coming aft
announced, with a look of relief, that the baggage
camels and one for me were only a mile or so
behind Jakoub.</p>

<p>“We’re lucky,” he said, “for I think there
is a land breeze coming up, and the sooner we’re
out of this the better. I only hope for your sake,
Mr. Davoren, it isn’t a ‘khamsin.’ I’d be sorry
if you made the acquaintance of the desert in a
sand-storm.”</p>

<p>I went below to finish my packing. Hassan showed
me with pride the hamper of provisions and wines
he had provided for the journey, together with
two great water-jars.</p>

<p>When I came back on deck, rather self-conscious
in my white suit and helmet, I saw the camels
crouching on the beach, and heard with dread
their deep guttural grumblings and threatenings
as their loads were roped on to them.</p>

<p>But what surprised me most of all was the
sudden appearance among us of a stranger. This
was a young clean-shaved Egyptian of the middle
class, dressed in a suit of drab linen with a tarboosh
on his head.</p>

<p>Edmund laughed as he came up to us with
an obsequious salaam.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[143]</span>“Let me introduce you to your dragoman,”
he said.</p>

<p>Then as the man looked up with a smile of
insufferable insolence, I saw that it was Jakoub!</p>

<p>He was not merely disguised by clothes; it
was the total change of the consummate artist.
It seemed that he <i>was</i> another man. He had
deliberately revealed himself by his smile, and
when that faded from his face, it was impossible
even to think of him as Jakoub, utterly impossible
to recognise him.</p>

<p>Edmund drew me aside.</p>

<p>“You’re not in the least likely to want this,”
he said, “but you never know. You had better
have it in case——”</p>

<p>He gave me a revolver, which I had unwillingly
to put in my pocket. It seemed an enormous
size and weight, and I always have a feeling that
these things go off of themselves. Still, when
I thought of Jakoub, I was glad to have it.</p>

<p>“Here’s another dozen rounds,” said Edmund,
“you can give me the lot back in Alexandria.”</p>

<p>The crew were already busy making sail under
Welfare’s directions.</p>

<p>I said good-bye to him with great regret. Edmund
came ashore with me in the dinghy.</p>

<p>I looked back and said, “Do you know this
is the first time I have seen the <i>Astarte</i> from outside?”</p>

<p>“So it is,” said Edmund. “Well, she’s pretty,
isn’t she?”</p>

<p>She looked very beautiful lying there, “Idle
as a painted ship upon a painted ocean,” her lines
aspiring to the tall pointed bows and the noble
length of her bowsprit, her tall pointed sails drooping
gracefully to their own reflection in the water.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[144]</span>“I am very, very sorry to leave her,” I said.</p>

<p>“I hope,” said Edmund gravely, “that whatever
happens you’ll always keep a kindly feeling
for her in your heart.”</p>

<p>Edmund led me up to my camel. The brute
slewed its head round and eyed us with a supercilious
and malevolent expression that reminded
me of Jakoub. It kept its mouth open, ready
to protest against whatever was done to it, showing
a great bunch of teeth in its lower jaw. As
we approached it made a noise as if it were gargling
its throat.</p>

<p>“All you’ve to do,” said Edmund, “is to nip
on to the saddle quickly and hang on to this
wooden upright. He’ll start getting up the minute
you’re on and that throws you about a bit, but
once he’s on his feet you’ll be all right and quite
comfortable. Cross your feet over his left shoulder,
and hold on to the upright at first till you’re
used to the motion. Keep him in a sort of half
trot if you can, it’s less tiring than walking. But
he’ll follow Jakoub’s beast anyhow.”</p>

<p>“What am I to do if he runs away?”</p>

<p>“He won’t do that. He’ll keep in the string
all right.”</p>

<p>I watched Jakoub mount, and with a great
effort of will-power followed his example.</p>

<p>I stretched one leg over the brute and was pulling
myself into my seat to an accompaniment
of appalling growls, when an earthquake seemed
to take place. I was flung forward, then backwards
and forwards again, and shot up skywards
at the same time, but remained safe on the bundle
of mats they called a saddle. I found myself
at a dizzy height with the camel’s greyish white
neck stretched out a long way below me, and a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[145]</span>
single slender rope in my hand to guide him
with.</p>

<p>However, the brute stood quiet. He was now
silent and showed no disposition to do untoward
things.</p>

<p>“Well done,” Edmund called up to me; “you’ll
be all right now.”</p>

<p>“I’m all right,” I said, “unless he turns round
and chews my feet.”</p>

<p>“He’s a tame beast. Don’t be uneasy. Good-bye.”</p>

<p>He reached up and I managed to catch his
hand.</p>

<p>“Good luck,” he said.</p>

<p>“Good-bye.”</p>

<p>As he went back to the dinghy, I could hear
the click of the <i>Astarte’s</i> windlass getting up the
anchor. Our string of camels moved off across
the sandhills, and I felt nervous, insecure, and
very lonely.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[146]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VIII<br>

<small>WE ARE CAUGHT IN A KHAMSIN</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap2">AS I got used to the apparent insecurity
of my position and the rocking motion
which the camel’s gait imposes on one,
I began to find something soothing in the slow
but dignified progression. The vast monotony
of the desert had a hypnotic effect, and I was even
anxious lest I might fall asleep and slip from my
lofty perch.</p>

<p>The heat was most oppressive, and I noticed a
new quality in the slight wind. It was from the
south, a quarter it had not blown from before,
and it came in puffs like a breath from the opened
door of a furnace; a dry fierce heat that burned
one’s cheek and made the eyes smart. In the
full glare of the afternoon sun, the desert was
disappointing in its monotony. I had read novels
full of “word-painting” and gush about the
“mystery and wonder” of the desert. I had seen
it in a moment of iridescent loveliness at dawn.
But now there was neither mystery nor beauty:
it was just sand, sand and loose stones, stretching
everywhere in billows to the ring of the horizon.
The ridges of sand hid nothing but other ridges,
and hollows full of sand. I found I hated it.</p>

<p>Away to the south, in the wind’s eye, the horizon
was darkened by a strange haze, yellowish brown,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[147]</span>
rising slowly higher in the sky, a queer, unnatural,
threatening cloud.</p>

<p>There were three Arab boys who trudged along
beside the baggage camels, occasionally addressing
what sounded like insults to them. I thought they
looked uneasily from time to time at the southern
sky, and tried to hurry the unwilling camels.</p>

<p>The hot wind blew every moment stronger
and more steadily, and now it blew up a cloud of
dust and sand from the shuffling feet of the camels.</p>

<p>Jakoub rode on ahead with a mounted Arab,
whom I took to be the owner, or at least the hirer
of the camels.</p>

<p>We were travelling about east-sou’-east, our
route making an acute angle with the coast. After
about an hour’s going, the desert rose to a stony
ridge where there was an outcrop of some pale
fossiliferous rock which lay in flat slabs like an
artificial pavement. Turning to look back from
the summit of this ridge I found I could see the
sea again. It was ruffled and grey. Darker
“cat’s-paws” flew over it here and there, and
already the waves were beginning to curl and show
white gleams of foam.</p>

<p>The <i>Astarte</i> was visible near the sky-line, standing
out to sea with a free sheet. My heart yearned
after her, as I thought of the familiar cosy saloon
and the friendly faces I had left.</p>

<p>Jakoub halted his camel and waited till I came
up. He salaamed respectfully, perfect in his
part of dragoman, and rode side by side with me.</p>

<p>“It will be a bad night, effendi,” he said. “It
is a khamsin.”</p>

<p>“Well, I suppose we must grin and bear it.”</p>

<p>I spoke boldly, though I quailed at the word
khamsin; I had heard so much of this dreaded wind.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[148]</span>“As long as the camels will travel,” he said.
“But the sky looks as if it will be a very bad sand-storm.”</p>

<p>“How far is it to this place we are going to?”</p>

<p>“If the camels go well, we might do it in six
hours, in five hours from now. But it will be
difficult to find the place in a sand-storm.”</p>

<p>“What is this ruin? Another Sheikh’s tomb?”</p>

<p>“No, no. This very great ruin. How do you
call a mosque of the ancients?”</p>

<p>“A temple?”</p>

<p>“That is it. It is the Temple of Osiris. Very
grand ruin. There is plenty shelter there for
all, camels and all.”</p>

<p>“Is there any shelter nearer?”</p>

<p>“We could go back where I fetch the camels
from. About two hours now.”</p>

<p>“How long will this storm last?”</p>

<p>“It is a khamsin; it may last three days.”</p>

<p>“Then we must go on and find the temple if
we can.”</p>

<p>“It is as your Excellency wishes.”</p>

<p>I had almost forgotten it was Jakoub speaking
through the mouth of this pleasant respectful
servant, but now he added with a touch of the
familiarity I loathed, “If anyone is looking for
Jakoub he will not find him in a khamsin.”</p>

<p>I ignored this remark.</p>

<p>“And they will not find what the camels are
loaded with,” he said with his most insolent sneer.</p>

<p>I could have chastised him with scorpions, but
I maintained silence, and only looked my disapproval.
I knew silence was more dignified than
any speech to such a man; besides, I had no doubt
at the time that he was trying to find out from
me what the packing-cases contained.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[149]</span>But there was in his smile a suggestion that
we shared some vile secret; a suggestion which
gave me nausea of the soul.</p>

<p>He trotted forward and rejoined his companion,
and at once I heard an order shouted to the foot-boys,
who began belabouring their camels, and the
whole procession moved forward at a mended pace.</p>

<p>I ventured to guide my camel a little to the right
so as to bring it to windward of the baggage camels
and out of the dust their feet stirred up. I was
gratified to find the animal obedient, even obsequious.</p>

<p>Then the wind suddenly grew stronger. I
cannot say it freshened, for it came as a hot blast
that burned and threatened. The surface of the
desert seemed to slide away from the camel’s feet,
as the loose sand shifts away with a receding wave
in shallow water. It made me giddy to look
down at it. The air became dark, opaque with
the sand blown up from a thousand miles of red-hot
desert.</p>

<p>The particles of sand drove and pricked my
skin. Sand filled my eyes and nostrils and stuck to
the streaming surface of my sweating face and
hands. I had to keep close to the baggage animals.
I had a horror of losing touch with them, in this
new strange opacity.</p>

<p>I knew that if I found myself alone I should
go mad with horror. I felt the beast under me
tremble with some similar terror, and for the first
time there was sympathy between us.</p>

<p>The scorching wind hummed in my ears with a
strange thin sound, mingled with the hiss of the
moving sand. It made my helmet a maddening
incumbrance, and set loose parts of my clothes and
the corners of the rugs I sat on flapping.</p>

<p>The flying sand was all around us now, and sky<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[150]</span>
and sun were blotted out. I knew that the sun
was near its setting and dreaded to think of the
darkness of night added to this new terrifying
darkness.</p>

<p>A blank misery of fear settled down upon me,
and I cursed the wretchedness of my discomfort.</p>

<p>It seemed impossible that I should be here,
perched unfamiliarly on the back of a camel, unprotected
and wretched amid the unknown dangers
of this horror of the sand. The thought of my
home came to me, of Bates and Mrs. Rattray!
What had brought me here?</p>

<p>The darkness became denser and denser and
I felt that the sun had set. But it’s going brought
no coolness. The burning wind seemed now to
parch my lungs. My camel was pressed up to the
baggage animals, its nose almost touching the
tail of the beast before it. It evidently shared
my dread of finding itself alone.</p>

<p>Much as I hated Jakoub it was a relief when
he again joined me.</p>

<p>“You all raight, effendi?” he asked.</p>

<p>“All right,” I said. I would not expose my
craven fear to him. I could have found it in my
heart to bless him when he handed me a bottle
of tepid water. As a rule I hate drinking out of a
bottle. I have seldom done it, I have not got the
knack. The motion of the camel did not make
it easier, and some of the precious water ran over
my chin and down my neck. Nevertheless that
was the most precious drink of all my lifetime.</p>

<p>“Shall we be able to find the way?” I asked.</p>

<p>“Oh yes, we will find it. The camels know,”
said Jakoub, “but we must not halt. It might
be impossible to make them start again.”</p>

<p>“I don’t want to halt.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[151]</span>“Good. The effendi is very strong, what you
call ‘very hard,’ is it not? There will be times
when we will be able to see a little with the moon,
when the sand will not be so thick in the air to
blind us. So, we will find the temple and rest.”</p>

<p>The man’s confidence encouraged me and I could
not but admire it in face of the wrath of Nature.</p>

<p>Every joint of me ached with the ungainly
motion of my mount, and my skin was become
as sodden paper. A stream of tears cut channels
in the dust that plastered my face. Sometimes
the darkness lightened a little, and a greenish
light filtered through the sand from the invisible
moon, reminding me of the faint light that comes
down through the water in glazed tanks of a darkened
aquarium.</p>

<p>I could now just see the pale hindquarters of the
beast in front of me, and the long neck and head
of my own solemnly bowing as it went.</p>

<p>I do not know how long this torment lasted,
for I lost all count of time. My only fear was
lest the camels should stop in their march, and
I counted every painful step a gain.</p>

<p>I had reached the stage of half-conscious misery
when suddenly the wind seemed to cease blowing.
There were harsh guttural shouts from the Arab
boys, and the camels stopped. Then I felt rather
than saw the loom of a vast building beside me on
my right.</p>

<p>An Arab boy came and took the head-rope from
my hand, and dragging at it he made a noise as
though he was clearing his throat of all the colds
that ever afflicted humanity. Again I was flung
backwards and forwards as my camel folded itself
up and came to rest on the ground. I slid off
too weak in the knees even to get out of the range<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[152]</span>
of its teeth. But the poor beast made no assault
on me, and I felt that it had carried me faithfully
and well and was grateful.</p>

<p>I saw a match struck, and Jakoub came up
with a lantern. My heart faintly warmed to him.</p>

<p>“All raight, effendi?” he asked again.</p>

<p>“All right,” I said. “You have done well
to find this place on such a night, Jakoub.”</p>

<p>“The camels have the wisdom that Allah has
bestowed,” he answered quite simply and humbly.</p>

<p>I came nearer liking him then than at any moment
of our short intercourse. But I distrusted him
profoundly all the same, and the pressure of
Edmund’s revolver against my hip was a kind of
comfort to me.</p>

<p>“This way, effendi,” he said, making a kind
of servile sweep with his lantern.</p>

<p>I followed him into what I took at first to be
a cave. But there was a hot draught and sand
blowing through it, and the swinging light of Jakoub’s
lantern lit up great blocks of stone that must have
been placed there by human agency. I don’t
know why, but I followed him more willingly
when I realised that I was among the work of human
hands, however many thousand years they had
been dead, than I would have followed into some
crevice that represented a mere process of Nature.
My feeling about Jakoub demanded human allies,
however remote in time.</p>

<p>I realised that this was some gateway or entrance
in the vast building that had saved us from the
sand-storm.</p>

<p>Jakoub turned sharply to the left, and I followed
him through a narrow entrance where I had to
stoop among enormous blocks of stone.</p>

<p>I found myself in a moderate-sized chamber.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[153]</span>
As far as I could see by the feeble light it was
built entirely of stone. Some of the stone was
blackened as though by fire. There was another
opening in the great stone-work that looked like
the beginning of a narrow staircase. But I was
too tired for exploration. The floor was soft
sand, and there was no wind blowing here.</p>

<p>I sat down thankfully and began scooping dust
out of my eyes.</p>

<p>Two of the Arab boys who had walked by the
baggage camels came in with rugs and mats, and
the hamper packed by Hassan.</p>

<p>Jakoub gave them directions in their own language,
and all these people busied themselves about
providing for my comfort.</p>

<p>I asked myself why I hated Jakoub, and how
I knew that he despised me. I did not know
these Arab boys at all. If among them they
had decided to put me to death, they would have
an easy task. They might have done it before
I could even have pointed my revolver at them.</p>

<p>Jakoub skilfully made a kind of couch for me
with the rugs, and opened the hamper. Hassan
had packed enough to keep me for a week, so there
was no need to economise. I did not know what
provisions Jakoub or the Arabs might have. After
all he had so far served me well. I offered him
some meat and bread, which he gratefully accepted.</p>

<p>“I suppose,” I said, “you do not drink wine,
Jakoub?”</p>

<p>“I keep the fast of Ramadan, Excellency,” he
said, “but for the rest of the year——” He ended
with a shrug and a smile which seemed to suggest
his belief in the tenderness of Allah towards human
nature which could not always live up to the exacting
standard of the Prophet.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[154]</span>“The wind has burned the roots of my tongue
and the sand grates in the gateway of my lungs,”
he added apologetically, as he drank off the tumbler
of Burgundy I handed him.</p>

<p>The wine revived him and I realised that he
too had been suffering from the exhaustion of our
terrible ride, but had waited on me before refreshing
himself.</p>

<p>I finished my strange picnic alone in this dim
vault of some old forgotten worship; then lying down
on the outspread rug, I slept profoundly in the sand.</p>

<p>When I awoke a faint daylight was trickling
in through a kind of irregular hole or tunnel in
the titanic masonry that surrounded me. A
distant humming of the wind recalled to my mind
the horrors of the storm outside, and I knew it
had not abated. During the night, sand had
drifted even into this chamber of mine. I was
covered with it as I lay, and I noticed it piled up
like snow against the farther wall.</p>

<p>But someone, Jakoub I knew it must be, had
left a canvas bucket of water beside me, and I
was able to have the wash my soul was craving for.</p>

<p>The faint light made me think that it was dawn,
although the heat even here was oppressive, but
looking at my watch I found it was twelve o’clock!
I had slept for ten hours. At first I could hardly
move my aching limbs.</p>

<p>But the healing touch of the water restored me.
My parched skin seemed to absorb it, and my
courage, such as it was, became restored. I began
to take a kind of pleasure in the sense of adventure,
and thought with pride of the story I should have
for the other old fogies at the Athenæum!</p>

<p>If I had had a companion I should have been
happy, but it was lonely work as it was.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[155]</span>I made a table of my hamper, and breakfasted
heartily on lukewarm ham and the remains of
the bottle of wine I had broached over-night.</p>

<p>Then I began to explore my surroundings.</p>

<p>I went down the short narrow passage leading
from the chamber, and found that it opened into
what looked at first like a tunnel through which the
wind and the sand still raved. This tunnel I found
was really a gateway piercing a vast wall, in the
thickness of which my chamber was built. I turned
to the right retracing our steps of the night before
and came out into the day, which I found was
darkened by the sand-storm. I huddled under
the lee of the great wall, and I could see the camels
were still lying there in a row, placidly chewing
the cud with a queer sideways movement of their
jaws. The nearest turned its head and looked
at me with a sneer of ineffable contempt.</p>

<p>I went back and found that opposite to the
passage which led to my chamber was another
similar opening.</p>

<p>Listening I heard the deep fierce tones of Arabic
talk and a man laughing. I guessed there must
be another chamber there where Jakoub and
the Arabs had taken refuge. I felt I would be
glad of even Jakoub’s society, but shyness prevented
my seeking him, shyness and nothing else!</p>

<p>I returned to my chamber, intent on exploring
the staircase or passage I had seen leading from it.</p>

<p>The opening led, as I thought, to remains of a
broken staircase, roughly spiral, in the thickness
of the great wall. Many of the steps were broken
away, and I was soon in darkness. I came back,
shuddering, for Jakoub’s lantern which he had
left with me, and stiff and sore and frightened
as I was, I clambered up and up and came at last<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[156]</span>
out into the rushing, blinding storm again, on
the top of the vast wall of the Temple.</p>

<p>It was broken into irregular masses of enormous
masonry, and must originally have been some twenty
feet in width. The tunnel piercing the bottom of
the wall was forty feet in length, and I guessed
I must be about sixty feet above the ground. But
the storm drove me down before I could form
any estimate of its length, or discover how much
of the building existed. I could see nothing through
the driving sand.</p>

<p>I came back to my chamber, which had already
begun to seem homelike to me, and Jakoub was
there waiting for me.</p>

<p>I was glad to see him. I think I would have
been glad of the company of an orang-utan, if
adequately chained, for I was finding out what a
horrible thing solitude can be although it was
not twenty-four hours since I had parted with
Edmund and Welfare.</p>

<p>Jakoub greeted me with his invariable “all
raight?” and I grunted at him for reply. I felt I had
a reputation as an English gentleman to maintain.</p>

<p>“We cannot start the camels to-day, effendi,”
he went on, “the sand is still very bad.”</p>

<p>“We didn’t reckon to travel to-day,” I reminded
him. “What about to-night?”</p>

<p>He shrugged his shoulders in his disgustingly
expressive way.</p>

<p>“No good, effendi. The camels would not
put their heads—I mean what you call—face
it. It may blow all to-morrow again, or it might
stop to-night.”</p>

<p>“Well, we’ve got to wait for it then, and not
worry,” I answered irritably. “How are you
and the other fellows off for food?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[157]</span>“We have enough to eat. The others like the
Excellency’s white bread if there is any to spare.
The wine made paradise of my stomach.”</p>

<p>I gave him a loaf of bread and a bottle of wine.</p>

<p>“What about water?” I asked.</p>

<p>“There is here a very good well. All the water
bottles I have filled. The camels have drunk
when they did not expect. They give thanks.
But the sand drives even here and there is to-day
and to-night. If the effendi likes and will come
five minutes through the storm I can show him
better shelter. Very good place, no wind, no
sand, very cool place.”</p>

<p>I was used now to the place I was in, and averse
from changing it until I started back to civilisation.
I was profoundly distrustful of Jakoub, and I did
not like the idea of going out again into that stinging
storm.</p>

<p>But the man offered me better quarters. I
had no good reason for refusing to try them. I
was determined not to seem to fear him, and my
wretched shyness prevented me from discussing
the matter and questioning him as any sensible
man would have done.</p>

<p>“Very well,” I said, “go on.”</p>

<p>He led me out again and we trod the ankle-deep
sand past where the camels lay. They were
of course unloaded and looked very contented
and supercilious.</p>

<p>We reached the limit of the great wall, and I
could just see that it was only one part of a vast
building; we were at an angle where another
wall met it. But the driving sand hid all the
mysteries of the structure. Jakoub led me away
from the Temple, and down the slope of a ridge
on which it seemed to be built. I had to keep my<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[158]</span>
head down for protection from the moving sand,
but even so I could see that I was stumbling over
masses of broken, worthless pottery. I passed
fragments of marble pillars and fractured capitals
lying in the sand. My feet slid on the loose sand
covering a portion of tessellated pavement.</p>

<p>There had been Greek artists here, and I knew
that, as I suspected, I was among the ruins of
some old Ptolemaic pleasaunce and place of worship.</p>

<p>Jakoub stopped.</p>

<p>“Down here, effendi,” he called through the
wind, pointing to a hole that the moving sand
had silted up but could not fill.</p>

<p>I hesitated. It was like being invited to go
down a rabbit-burrow. Jakoub disappeared down
the hole, and his lean, brown, beautiful hand
alone was left inviting me to follow.</p>

<p>I took his hand and went down after him. It
was impossible to hesitate, alone there in that
blinding hurricane. I slid down through sand,
and sand followed my clumsy descent like an
avalanche. Then I found my feet on rock. I
felt my way down a rough descent, with Jakoub’s
loathed assistance, and I found myself on level
solid ground in total darkness.</p>

<p>Jakoub had brought his lantern and lit it at once.</p>

<p>At first I could see nothing but his hated face,
smiling into mine.</p>

<p>“All raight here, effendi,” he said, and behind
him I saw all the packing-cases the camels had
carried.</p>

<p>Although I had seen the camels were relieved
of their loads, I had never thought of how the
things might be bestowed. I had thought of nothing
but my own discomfort, and had accepted all
Jakoub’s efforts to lessen it. He and his Arabs<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[159]</span>
must have worked hard to get all this merchandise
down here, while I slept. I recognised that he
did not despise me without some reason.</p>

<p>Of course Edmund or Welfare would have seen
the stuff bestowed before anything else. I had
shown myself a mere passenger.</p>

<p>Jakoub saw me looking at the packing-cases.</p>

<p>“They would be hard to find here, like Jakoub,”
he said.</p>

<p>I took the lantern from him, and began to examine
the cave, for such I took it to be.</p>

<p>I found myself in a large rectangular chamber
hewn out of the solid rock that here closely underlay
the desert sand.</p>

<p>At one end of it I found a grave-like excavation
about three feet deep and six feet long. I saw
the remains of an earthenware pipe leading into
it, and turned away with an involuntary shudder.</p>

<p>In the opposite wall there was a narrow pointed
opening. I had to stoop to go through it, and
found myself in a circular chamber. There were
low seats, or sedilia, carved in the rock all around,
and over each seat a square niche cut in the rock.
In the centre were the broken remains of a slab
of rock which could only have been an altar.</p>

<p>I did not know what hateful rites had been
celebrated on it, but everything told me I was
in a place of ancient secret worship. I recalled
a smattering recollection of Mithraic superstition
with its blood-bath. That was probably the
meaning of the grave-like place with its conduit.
Here men had hidden themselves from the light
of day 2,000 years ago, and here a man lost now
would never be recovered.</p>

<p>Jakoub smiled in my face. I put my hand
on the revolver. If this were a trap he had led<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[160]</span>
me into, I swore to myself that he should die in
it too.</p>

<p>“No sand comes here,” he said. “The effendi
will be cool while we wait.”</p>

<p>It was evident that the man was still considering
only my comfort. My fears of him were nothing
but the cowardice of jangled nerves.</p>

<p>The two Arab boys joined us, bearing my rugs
and hamper, some extra candles, and a copy of
<i>The Contemporary Review</i> with an article of my
own in it; the sort of encumbrance that clings
so long to civilised man. And under Jakoub’s directions
they proceeded to make a kind of couch for
me, where I should be able to spend the hours before
us in comparative comfort.</p>

<p>Then they left me. I began to read my own
article in the review, but I found that matters
that had once seemed intensely interesting and
important had become profoundly boring, and I
slept.</p>

<p>I suppose it was exhaustion, but I slept most
of that afternoon. I fed again and went to sleep
again. So I spent those hours amid circumstances
that from a distance would have seemed the most
enthralling. But I had examined this weird subterranean
chamber. Its bare rock faces had nothing
more to tell my ignorance. I had not the knowledge
or experience to interpret the history that might be
graven on them.</p>

<p>I slept again lightly, and not for very long.
Consciousness returned in the form of uneasiness.
I was in utter darkness, but awake and alert.
I was in no uncertainty as to my whereabouts
or the recent events that had brought me there.
I was not even quite sure that I had slept.</p>

<p>I knew I had but to stretch out my hand to find<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[161]</span>
a box of matches and light my candle, but I found
I could not make the effort. Fear kept my hand
immobilised. I can say honestly that it was no
mere superstitious dread of my surroundings. I
was perfectly conscious of my unseen environment
of hewn rock beneath the remote desert. I was
untroubled by any thought of possible horrors
enacted there in the distant past. Yet I was
afraid, afraid of some human presence that I knew
was there, invisible and unfelt, unheard, yet palpable
in the darkness and silence which surrounded me.
I lay there conscious that my face was distorted
by fear, waiting, longing for something, anything
that would stimulate any normal human sense.
I think I could have welcomed the thrust of a
dagger if it had ended that horrible suspense in the
darkness of the old subterranean church of a forgotten
religion.</p>

<p>Something moved near me and the spell was
broken. I was aware of myself sitting up, my
blanket thrown aside, my left arm doubled across
my face by some defensive instinct.</p>

<p>“Who is that?” said a voice that must have
been mine.</p>

<p>Without knowing what I did, my right hand went
out and found the matches beside me. The box
rattled faintly as I grasped it, and before it rattled
again, before I could move it towards my left hand,
my hand was seized and held in a soft firm grip.</p>

<p>I fell backwards again incapable of effort. “No
light, effendi. Make no sound. There is danger.”</p>

<p>It was Jakoub’s voice, whispering.</p>

<p>I dreaded and feared the man, yet I knew his
whisper was not that of my murderer. I felt
that for the time at all events we were allies against
some unknown danger threatening us both.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[162]</span>“What is it?” I asked, whispering like him.
“Let go my hand.”</p>

<p>“You will make no light, if my hand leaves
your hand?”</p>

<p>“No; not till you tell me. Why are you here?”</p>

<p>The delicate firm pressure of his hand was removed,
and I was again out of touch with the universe.
But I was relieved. All those visceral disturbances
which attend pure fright began to adjust themselves.
The pumping of my heart ceased to be palpable,
the rhythm of my breathing was restored, and
I was conscious that I was no longer making queer
faces in the dark. These are but normal reactions
to stimuli, labelled “cowardice” by the insensitive.
I am as little inclined to apologise for them as for
hunger or sea-sickness. They passed, and reflection
returned to aid my will.</p>

<p>“Why have you come, Jakoub?” I asked of
the darkness. It was strange to speak, not knowing
in which direction to send my voice, nor whether
my hearer was close to me or far away.</p>

<p>“I must remain here with you, effendi. Those
who seek me have come. They too shelter from the
storm. They seek also this that we have brought
with us. But Allah is merciful, and I remembered
to put it here where they will not find it.”</p>

<p>From the sound of Jakoub’s whisper I could
tell that his usual imperturbability had gone.
There was fear in every syllable he uttered. Fear
is said to be contagious, yet I took heart. “Those
who sought him” must be the police. I knew, of
course, that he was a hunted man. But I had
nothing to fear from the police, and as yet I had
no reason to suppose that they were concerned
with our merchandise. They would, of course,
examine it if they found it, and that, as Welfare<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[163]</span>
had so carefully explained, would spoil the market
for our “rare earths for incandescent mantles.”</p>

<p>I felt that I had nothing to lose by their discovering
Jakoub. I shrank from the thought of
sharing with him a long vigil in this subterranean
darkness, and his arrest would rescue me from this.</p>

<p>Even if I wanted to, however, I could make no
move to compass his arrest. At present he was
in a sense my protector, at least my ally. The
least suspicious move on my part would convert
him into a deadly and ruthless foe, and I remembered
how he had instantly found my hand as though he
saw in the darkness, while I was blind and helpless.</p>

<p>Looking back now, I think all these prudential
calculations passed through my mind really in
an attempt to justify a feeling of loyalty to what
was after all my side. However I might hate and
distrust Jakoub, I was yet pledged in a sense to
abide by him.</p>

<p>So I resigned myself to the long wait, crouching
there in the darkness of our stone vault.</p>

<p>“How long will these men stay?” I asked at
length.</p>

<p>“When the khamsin ends they will go; unless
the camel-men betray us.”</p>

<p>“And can you trust them?”</p>

<p>“I trust no Arab. But they know it is death to
betray me. But one can come in here at a time.
Allah is very merciful and my knife is sharp. Many
would die before Jakoub is taken. If the Excellency
will agree now to make no light or sound,
I go to wait by the entry. It will soon be day and
a little light will come then. But to one from
outside it will be dark in here. He would feel the
knife of Jakoub before he saw it, and then he
would see no more.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[164]</span>“Go, Jakoub,” I said, “I will not move.”</p>

<p>There was no sound but I somehow felt that
Jakoub was withdrawn from close beside me.</p>

<p>For a long time, as it seemed to me, I crouched
there, my hands clasped round my knees, wondering
if I were destined to be the helpless witness of a
murder or series of murders.</p>

<p>But gradually the strain on my mind, the heat
and the close unchanged air numbed my spirits.
I sank back thankfully on my rug, and slept as
soundly as though I were back in my own vicarage.</p>

<p>I awoke unwillingly and unrested. There was a
dim light by which I could just discern the graven
rock that formed the walls and roof of our refuge—or
our prison.</p>

<p>It was Jakoub’s voice calling softly that had
awakened me. I could see the outline of his figure
squatting like a graven image by the entry, and
a faint gleam from the blade of his knife. Untiring
he had watched there motionless while I had slept.</p>

<p>“Well, Jakoub?” I questioned.</p>

<p>“It is day, effendi, and the storm has gone.
The khamsin has spared us one day. The leader
of the camels has come, and says my enemies
have gone. But that may be a trap.”</p>

<p>I rose wearily and went over to Jakoub. By
the entry there was a freshness in the air that
revived me, and I noticed there was no longer any
humming of the wind.</p>

<p>“How shall we know if it is a trap, Jakoub?”</p>

<p>He fondled the knife in his hand, and then looked
up at me with pleading in his eyes. It was the
first time he had humbled himself to me, and I
saw that a vision of the gaol at Tourah was very
clear to him.</p>

<p>“I like not to ask it,” he said at last; “but if<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[165]</span>
the effendi had courage to go first they would not
harm him, and Jakoub would at least be warned.
If Jakoub must die, he will take some with him,
to bear false witness against him before the Prophet.
But the Prophet is not deceived. He will intercede
with Allah, and Allah is merciful to the true
believer.”</p>

<p>Nothing could better have restored my self-esteem
than this appeal. I had hitherto been
entirely dependent on this abhorred protector;
but now he needed my aid and appealed to my
courage.</p>

<p>I said no more, but walked past him and climbed
up the steep and narrow entry to the desert surface
above, dazzled indeed by the glare of light, but
thankful to breathe again the fresh pure air of
morning that was wafted across by a faint sea-breeze.
The terrible oppression of the hot wind
had gone. The sand was at rest. My spirits
rose as, looking around, I saw no trace of the enemy.</p>

<p>The sun was just rising and the desert lay once
more sparkling and burnished beneath its level rays.</p>

<p>I saw before me the stately mass of the great
Temple of Osiris.</p>

<p>The mighty wall, wherein I had spent the first
night and morning, was revealed as part of a great
quadrangle enclosing an <i>enceinte</i> of about 100 yards
square.</p>

<p>The wall and the gateway, which I seemed to
know as a blind man knows things by his sense
of touch, were the only parts of the building which
retained any semblance of its original design. The
rest was a vast tumbled ruin, wrecked by man
and his unruliness, by Nature and by Time.</p>

<p>I climbed again to the summit of the great wall
where I had been the day before.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[166]</span>There was a cool refreshing breeze, and I could
see around me the great ruin, and on the slope
below it what I took to be the outlines of a Ptolemaic
pleasure city that had once been busy and important
under the shadow of the Temple’s walls.</p>

<p>Now the desert lay utterly barren all round,
and far in the distance I could just see the sea with
that bewildering blue of the butterfly’s wing.</p>

<p>Looking inland I could still make out on the
horizon a dozen horsemen, and through my field-glasses
could see the white uniforms, the red tarbooshes
and slung carbines which I presumed
were worn by mounted police or troopers of the
Egyptian army. Jakoub’s enemies had certainly
gone. His cunning and foresight and the labours
of those old worshippers of Mithras had saved him
for the time being.</p>

<p>Below me the Arabs were busy reloading the camels,
and I was eager to be on the road again, willing
enough to leave behind me all these relics of ancient
mystery and magnificence which for me were
associated with that night of vigil and horror.</p>

<p>A few hours later the Temple had faded like a
dream into the sand that surrounded us, as our
party toiled across the last few miles to the railway.</p>

<p>We came to it at last, a wavy track following
the contours of the desert, an iron link with
civilisation.</p>

<p>There was a plain stone building for a station,
and Jakoub was almost immediately in the midst
of a wordy fracas with the station-master.</p>

<p>This functionary came out and inspected our
camels and their loads. He immediately fell
into a state of almost maniacal excitement. My
smattering of Arabic was not sufficient to enable
me to gather more than the merest fragment of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[167]</span>
his complaint, but he seemed to be calling Allah and
the Prophet to witness that no freight-train ever
could or would take such a load as ours was.</p>

<p>Jakoub let him rave; but the camel-boys joined
in, whether on the station-master’s side or against
him I could not tell. Even the camels put in their
word.</p>

<p>When they were all out of breath, Jakoub said
a few sharp authoritative words which started the
whole tornado of sound again.</p>

<p>This happened several times, and then Jakoub
came up to me.</p>

<p>“He requires 150 piastres backshish, effendi. There
is a train coming in half an hour. Had I more
time I would make him to take less.”</p>

<p>I was so relieved to know that the train was
nearly due that I did not grudge the money.</p>

<p>The camels were unloaded, and their owners
led them away in dignified gratitude for liberal
backshish.</p>

<p>The train came up like a miracle out of the
desert.</p>

<p>There was another scene with the guard; but
now Jakoub had a firm supporter in the station-master,
and for the consideration of a 100-piastre
note the whole of our cargo was safely stowed
on board.</p>

<p>A feeling of intense relief from responsibility
came over me as I found myself back in the impossibly
familiar surroundings of a first-class compartment,
and four hours of heat and dust were the
end of my physical discomfort.</p>

<p>Remembering Edmund’s injunction I wiped
my heated face and neck and donned my clerical
collar as the train ran into the Gare de Caire at
Alexandria.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[168]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER IX<br>

<small>THE DOPE TRADE</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">I&#8202; HAVE said that Jakoub had compelled my
grudging respect as he faced the sand-storm.
Now I had to recognise in him again a master
of circumstance, as from a fiercely clamouring
crowd of apparently hostile natives, and some
over-excited railway officials, he mobilised a little
force of porters, and conjured from somewhere
a kind of wagon, or rather a long beam mounted
on two pairs of wheels and drawn by a couple
of under-sized ponies.</p>

<p>On this he had all our cargo stowed in the time
an ordinary man would have taken to find a hat-box.
He had a <i>gharry</i> ready for me, with my
hold-all on the front seat. Our tickets were
delivered up, and the crowd more or less pacified
with backshish. We drove off, watched with
haughty indifference by a couple of Egyptian
policemen.</p>

<p>I was back in the world of men and wires, and
my first care was to send a cable home.</p>

<p>I had decided on Bates as the recipient of the
first news of my resurrection.</p>

<p>So we stopped at the office of the Eastern Telegraph
Company.</p>

<p>I had thought out my message during the long
weeks in which I had been tending to this ganglion<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[169]</span>
in the nervous system of the world, and I cabled
simply “Unable to communicate earlier. Returning
next boat via Marseilles.”</p>

<p>There was no need to say I was writing, as I
would be home as soon as a letter, and in any case
I felt that it would be utterly impossible ever
to explain why I had been lost so long. I intended
simply to say that the weather had tempted me
to a longer cruise than I had contemplated, and
that I had not had time to write.</p>

<p>Snape, I felt, would believe this; Bates and
Mrs. Rattray would not care, so long as I returned
at last in safety and health; and some day I
would tell the whole story to the bishop. There
was really no one else who would be either curious
or concerned, though Marshall would doubtless
be glad not to have to apply to a court of law
to “presume my death,” and some day I would
certainly swagger a little in my corner at the
Athenæum about my adventure in the sand,
and my exploration of the Temple of Osiris.</p>

<p>I had begun to think of myself as more in my
element at the Savage or the Travellers’!</p>

<p>I posted Captain Welfare’s letter to his agent
and we arrived at Van Ermengen’s Hotel, a pleasant
spacious place facing the sea, from which
it was only separated by the wide tram-girt road
and the sea-wall.</p>

<p>Van Ermengen, the proprietor, met us in the
hall. He was a thin, grave man, with a hard
face so narrow that his profile seemed to be cut
out of the edge of it. He had a cramped mouth
and restless, rather anxious eyes, as colourless
as his face and hair.</p>

<p>He received me very graciously, and made no
difficulty about my wagon-load of packing-cases.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[170]</span>
He instructed Jakoub, who arranged with the
hall-porter about their disposal. He seemed very
anxious to explain to me that he was of English
“nationality,” and that his establishment was
run on “English lines.” He did not seem to
know Jakoub, and apparently had no curiosity
about me, not even asking my name, or expecting
me to write it in a book.</p>

<p>I suppose it is impossible to take me for anything
but a British parson, for he had assumed
my nationality before I spoke, and addressed
me in English.</p>

<p>It was my first experience of a European hotel
in the Near East, and I was a little astonished
at the vast size and the bareness of my bedroom.
But it was delightfully cool. The sun was just
setting over the sea on which three tall windows
of my chamber looked, and the sea-breeze blew
freshly into the room. I looked out longingly
with the desire to see the sails of the <i>Astarte</i> coming
into port; but there was nothing in sight
but a couple of feluccas and a distant steamer.</p>

<p>A window at the side opened on a narrow street,
and I looked down curiously at the busy Oriental
scene in the violet transparency that fills the streets
of Alexandria at sunset.</p>

<p>Then I went and wallowed long and luxuriously
in a great bath, and shaved myself decently and
respectably again.</p>

<p>After my scorching in the desert the evening
seemed cool enough for ordinary clothes, and it
was with a curious sense of luxury that I put
on the dark clerical suit that had last been folded
by Bates in my dressing-room at home.</p>

<p>There were still some minutes before the vaunted
“English dinner” would be served at eight o’clock.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[171]</span>
I lit a cigarette and sat down by an open window
watching the rapid onset of night and the assembling
of the stars.</p>

<p>Hungry as I was I realised that I was very
tired. I could have slept where I was; but I
did not wish to sleep. There was on me that
feeling of excitement, almost of elation, that comes
with physical fatigue after a long strain is
relaxed.</p>

<p>I was glad to be rid of my queer and rather
doubtful responsibility, and to have succeeded
in my first commercial mission, but I regretted
the end of what had seemed a momentous interlude
in my uneventful life.</p>

<p>It seemed stupid to go straight home, but home
called me. This was not the season for travel
in Egypt, and anyhow, the experiences of a tourist
would seem insipid after my journey over sea
and land. I decided to revisit the country in
the orthodox way, perhaps the following winter,
and meantime I must go home.</p>

<p>Then into my mind rushed all those mundane
details inevitable in what we call civilisation,
which had been banished since I first put foot
on the deck of the <i>Astarte</i>.</p>

<p>I had sent word that I would sail by the next
boat, but now it occurred to me that I might
not have money enough for the journey. If
Edmund did not come in time how was I to get
it? I knew nobody in this city, and even if my
bankers cabled money, I was not sure how I could
draw it without any means of identification.</p>

<p>I could no doubt find an English banker, or
consul, or official of some kind, but he would ask
questions. He would naturally want to know
why an English clergyman, claiming to have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[172]</span>
ample means, found himself suddenly without
resources in Alexandria? He would ask had
I not arranged a letter of credit? He would
want to know what boat I had come out by, and
where I had stopped while in Egypt?</p>

<p>The blood rushed to my face as I thought of
it. Who on earth would believe my tale of the
<i>Astarte</i> and Jakoub, and my camel ride, even
if I dared to tell it?</p>

<p>I <i>might</i> make what was left of my money do,
but I reflected that Jakoub had earned something
handsome in the way of a tip. He had not only
refrained from taking my life; he might almost
be said to have saved it.</p>

<p>I went down to the big dining-room with my
mind full of these grovelling details; as certain
that my connection with the episode of the merchandise
was at an end, as I was convinced that
my muscles ached with fatigue.</p>

<p>But if we deny the existence of Chance or of
the Fates we shall have to include a sense of humour
among the attributes of the Deity. It was what
men call Chance that now prolonged the game
of cup-and-ball the gods were playing with me.</p>

<p>The head-waiter was indicating my solitary
table with the extraordinary gesticulations and
grimaces of his kind, when I heard my name called
out in a shout of surprise.</p>

<p>A tall man in the uniform of the Egyptian army
rose from an adjoining table and came across to
me, with a beaming smile and outstretched hand.</p>

<p>“You don’t know me from Adam,” he exclaimed.
“It’s this bally uniform.”</p>

<p>“Brogden!” I cried, in a flash of recognition.</p>

<p>“Good shot!” he said. “It’s jolly to find
one’s not quite forgotten after all these years.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[173]</span>
What on earth are you doing here? But you
must come to my table, and we’ll tell each other
all about ourselves.”</p>

<p>He had me by the arm and walked me across
the room to his table.</p>

<p>Again my will had nothing to do with events.</p>

<p>I watched the waiters doing conjuring tricks
with knives and forks and napkins, as they rearranged
the table, and gaped in astonishment
at my old friend.</p>

<p>For he was an old friend, once almost my dearest
friend, although I had forgotten his existence.</p>

<p>“I had no idea you were in Egypt,” I said.
“You went into the Civil Service. I have heard
nothing of you since.”</p>

<p>“No, you old devil! I wrote you two letters
and didn’t get an answer. And then—you know
the way, one loses touch.”</p>

<p>I knew. We went on for a time each making
the futile excuses and offering the explanations
that men do for lapsed friendships when they
are renewed by chance. We had been dear friends
at Oxford for several terms, and had normally,
and without unpleasantness, been separated by
circumstance. There was nothing to apologise
for.</p>

<p>The great majority of our friendships are determined
by propinquity. Time and space have
dominion over more of them than death can
claim.</p>

<p>“I heard of your coming into the Irish estate,”
Brogden was saying. “I must congratulate you.
But I see you are still a Padré. Do you know,
I have only seen you once before since you were
ordained? You’re down from Cairo, I suppose?
It’s a bit hot there now but I suppose you have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[174]</span>
finished the usual beat. You got to Assuan, of
course?”</p>

<p>This was just the kind of cross-examination
I wanted to avoid.</p>

<p>“No,” I said, “I couldn’t manage Assuan
this trip. I hope to come next winter; I must
keep your address. But my tourist experiences
won’t be very interesting to an old resident. But
tell me about yourself. How long have you been
in the army?”</p>

<p>“Oh, I’m not a pukka soldier,” he explained
with a laugh, “though I wear this kit and am
known as ‘Brogden Bey’! We Egyptian officials
sometimes trickle in and out of uniform
as a matter of expediency. I’m really a rather
superlative kind of policeman at present.”</p>

<p>“I don’t understand at all. Let’s hear your
story right from the beginning.”</p>

<p>“Well, you remember I passed rather decently
into the Civil Service? Eighth or ninth, I think.”</p>

<p>“I remember it very well. We rejoiced together
in town. It was just before I took Orders.”</p>

<p>“Yes. I remember that dinner! I had taken
a pretty good degree, and after that I had to go
to an expensive crammer for three months to
be sure of a decent place in that exam. I was
nearly at the top in classics, history and law, but
my higher maths let me down. Good God! the
things one knew then! The Civil Service candidate
has to do a lot of mental vomiting after
his exam before he is quite human again. However,
having demonstrated my amazing acquirements
as a scholar, they gave me a job in the
Printed Book Department of the British Museum.
I had to lick the labels for the backs of new volumes
of the Supplementary Catalogue.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[175]</span>“No, I’m not joking,” he broke off in answer
to my glance, “that is literally what I had to
do. There was a man there who had been doing
it for twelve years. He had been crammed even
tighter than me for the exam., and he was quite
unfit for anything else, poor chap! I didn’t
see my way to become Chief Librarian either,
and I was frightened of getting cancer of the
tongue. I wrote to an uncle of mine who was
then one of Cromer’s men out here, and he got
me a billet in the Ministry of the Interior. I
rather took to the languages, and happened to
make myself useful in the Criminal Investigation
Department, and—here I am.”</p>

<p>“But what about the army? What are you
doing now?”</p>

<p>“Let’s go and have our coffee in the lounge,”
he said. “It’s a bit public here for chatting.”</p>

<p>We found a retired sofa at the end of the wide
cool lounge, and a white-gowned Arab with crimson
sash brought us coffee.</p>

<p>“What liqueur will you have?” asked Brogden.
“Don’t drink before sunset in the hot
weather, but don’t go to bed teetotal if you want
to keep fit. Their cognac is not fit to drink without
some curaçoa in it.”</p>

<p>He had evidently taken charge of me; apparently
someone always did, so I let him order the
liqueurs.</p>

<p>“You haven’t told me yet what you are doing
now,” I reminded him.</p>

<p>He bent forward mysteriously and whispered
one word, “<i>hashish</i>.”</p>

<p>I was about to repeat it aloud when he stopped
me with a gesture.</p>

<p>“Don’t shout about it,” he said. “I’m not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[176]</span>
supposed to talk, and I don’t want even the English
people here to know what I’m about. But it can’t
matter telling you, and you’d be surprised what
a relief it is to talk to someone!”</p>

<p>I was thankful to have started him on a topic
that would keep him from questioning me till
bedtime.</p>

<p>“That’s some kind of drug, isn’t it? I remember
it in the <i>Arabian Nights</i>.”</p>

<p>“Good Lord! Where have you put yourself
in Egypt? Yes, it’s a ‘kind of drug,’ as you
say.” He whispered again, “It’s <i>Cannabis indica</i>,
<i>Indian hemp</i>, in the medical books. We call
it the other thing. It’s meat and drink, wife
and family, lunacy and lingering death to the
Oriental when he gets fond of it. Drink’s a boon
and a blessing, and opium is mother’s milk to
it. We’ve stopped it being cultivated, and we’ve
prohibited its importation. We’re still trying to
stop its being smuggled. That’s my job at present.
I’ve been given a semi-military appointment with
the temporary rank of colonel, Egyptian colonel
of course, but that’s a blind.”</p>

<p>Any story of smuggling has always had a certain
fascination for me. I became interested at once,
and forgot my fatigue and my longing for bed.
I thought it seemed a whimsical thing that I should
live over a reputed smuggler’s passage, and now
find in an old friend a modern “preventive man.”</p>

<p>“That must be an interesting job,” I said.
“Tell me as much as you can. I needn’t tell
you I have sense enough to keep my mouth shut.”</p>

<p>“I know you will. You see, the natives, especially
the wealthy ones, <i>will</i> have the stuff, and
they simply don’t care what they pay. Naturally,
the value of it has become enormous—incredible.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[177]</span>
These damned Arabs and Levantines are always
slipping it in. But there’s a bigger trade going
on. They grow it regularly now in Greece, and
the Greek Government won’t lift a finger to stop
it. There’s too much backshish about. It will
be a big thing for me if I succeed. At present
I’m sorry to say I’m on the track of two renegade
Englishmen.”</p>

<p>“Englishmen?” I repeated. “That’s bad.”</p>

<p>“It’s damnable,” he said. “You can’t imagine
how we depend on prestige out here. If I could
get evidence against them, we should have to
keep it quiet here and have them dealt with at
home. At present I’ve only suspicions to go
on; but they’re in tow with a rascally native.
The biggest blackguard in the trade. He was
in the police and got to know all the ropes. Some
years ago he made a big coup, collared two feluccas
full of the stuff near the Western Frontier. There
was thousands of pounds’ worth of the drug in
them, and he had risked his life a dozen times
to bring it off, to say nothing of the brains he
showed. Of course, he was entitled to a reward,
and what do you think they offered him?”</p>

<p>“I’ve no idea.”</p>

<p>“<i>Five pounds</i>,” he groaned.</p>

<p>“Think of it!” he continued a moment later.
“Five pounds to a man like that! He put the
money back on the desk, smiled, saluted and
disappeared. The fellow who had to offer him
the money told me his smile as he saluted keeps
him awake at night still—the memory of it, I
mean. He’s had to take a long sick-leave on
account of insomnia. Of course, the man went
straight into the trade, and I fancy he really
organises the whole business. I’ve all the evidence<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[178]</span>
I want against him, and when I get him,
he’ll give away his English pals all right.”</p>

<p>“What’s his name?” I asked to fill another pause.</p>

<p>“Oh, names don’t count with a fellow like that.
He’ll answer to anything—Osman, Ali, Jakoub—‘anything
that comes to ’and,’ as the old lady
said of her goat.”</p>

<p>“Jakoub?” I asked, startled.</p>

<p>“Yes. Why?”</p>

<p>A blur of impressions and calculations mingled
in my tired mind. It suddenly occurred to me
that the description was like our Jakoub. But
he had been on the <i>Astarte</i> all this time. Nothing
fitted in. Still, some instinct made me
disinclined to give any particulars about my
enemy, if such I could still consider him.</p>

<p>“Jakoub is my dragoman’s name,” I replied.</p>

<p>“It’s a common enough name,” said Brogden
with a laugh. “They’ve only got about a dozen
names among them.”</p>

<p>“But what have these Englishmen got to do
with it?”</p>

<p>“They run the damned ship. A wretched
little Greek schooner they picked up here, interned
during the Balkan war, and sold for a song. They
profess to be making money out of the fruit trade,
which of course is rot.”</p>

<p>I was aware only of the effort to keep any revealing
emotion from my face. Suddenly and quite
clearly I had seen who were the two “renegade
Englishmen.” I had only one idea—that they
were in danger of betrayal by Jakoub. How he
had managed to deceive them, or how far they
might be compromised, I did not try to guess.
My only thought was that Brogden was now an
enemy, a skilful, questing enemy on the track<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[179]</span>
of a frightful misapprehension. I felt my skin
grow cold as I thought what a mere chance it
was that I had not told him my story, enough
of it anyhow to lead him straight to Jakoub—and
Edmund’s disgrace. People would never
understand that Edmund was innocent. Suddenly
the question occurred to me—“Would they understand
that I was?”</p>

<p>Brogden was talking all the time, and now I
listened again.</p>

<p>“I was making things so hot for them that
they left the Mediterranean in the beginning of
this year. They’re experts at dodging signal
stations, and I lost track of them till they got
to London. Ship’s papers, manifest, cargo and
everything all right, but the police got warrants
out for the Arab in the name of Osman Hamouda.
Then they disappeared again. We hoped to pick
them up at Jersey, where we found they had
relations with some very shady customers. I
don’t know what their game was, but there’s
sporadic smuggling going on there still in the
old commodities whenever a chance offers. However,
we missed them again. They got warned
somehow and disappeared. I shouldn’t be surprised
if they’re back in the Mediterranean. We’ll
find them with a perfectly innocent cargo of bananas
or something!”</p>

<p>Brogden laughed, and then I heard him exclaim,
“Hallo! What’s the matter? You’re ill!”</p>

<p>A great darkness had come on me through
which I seemed to hear his voice as a teasing sound
at a distance.</p>

<p>I saw it all now. <i>Edmund had known all along!</i></p>

<p>“No. I’m all right now; a bit fagged, and
the heat.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[180]</span>“Let me help you to your room.”</p>

<p>“No, no thanks. I can walk all right.”</p>

<p>I stood up to show him that I could, and to
my surprise I was really dizzy. I swayed and
sat down awkwardly on the couch. But my
mind was clearing.</p>

<p>“Stop there a bit,” he said authoritatively,
and rang the bell.</p>

<p>“Here, Esmah,” he called to the Arab, “get
a whisky, get two, large ones, and some soda.”</p>

<p>I swallowed the whisky, longing only to be
left alone.</p>

<p>“That’s better,” I said, and this time I managed
to rise quite steadily; “I’ll turn in, I think,
if you don’t mind. Many thanks. Good-night.”</p>

<p>“Well, I’ll look you up to-morrow.”</p>

<p>He came to the foot of the staircase with me,
and I felt he was watching me as I went up. I
turned at the landing and smiled, I think quite
naturally. He waved a hand, and I was rid of
him at last and alone in my room.</p>

<p>I wanted to think everything out and understand
as far as I could. But thought was blotted
out by emotion. My mind seemed blackened
by the sense of Edmund’s degradation. Less
worthily, but I suppose not unnaturally, there
simmered the sense of personal humiliation and
affront.</p>

<p>Edmund had associated with Welfare and Jakoub
in making of me their tool and dupe. In my
bitterness I accused them of laughing at my
innocence. But I knew at once I wronged them
in that. I knew enough of the good in both of
them to realise the wretchedness for them of our
association during those weeks on the <i>Astarte</i>.
Then I began dimly to perceive the hold that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[181]</span>
Jakoub had obtained over them. I tried to put
away all these profitless ponderings and think
out what was now to be done, how some shreds
of honour were to be saved, or at least depravity
concealed. I remembered the cargo of “curios”
brought into my house, and realised it must be
contraband, and the shop in Brighton only an
agency for its sale.</p>

<p>But my mind refused to think it out then. I
went disconsolate to bed, and was mercifully
surprised by sleep.</p>

<p>I slept heavily until the Arab came with my
tea and opened the lowered shutters that closed
my windows.</p>

<p>I awoke with my body refreshed and mind alert.</p>

<p>As though I had thought it out in the night,
I saw that I must at once get control of that
abominable stuff. Whatever happened it should
not be released to poison the souls and bodies
of men. I would be a passenger no longer, but
must act now.</p>

<p>I hated and feared the timidity and indolence
that I had made a sort of petted habit.</p>

<p>As soon as I was dressed I went downstairs
and sent for Van Ermengen.</p>

<p>He came, smiling and urbane, and wished me
good morning.</p>

<p>“Good morning. Those packing-cases of mine?”</p>

<p>“Yes?”</p>

<p>“I want them brought up to my bedroom.”</p>

<p>There was a sudden hardening of his face, and
I remembered Edmund saying, “Van Ermengen
knows all about the consignment.” I was certain
now that he did know all, that he was “in the
trade.” It was evident too that he had assumed—how
rightly!—that I knew nothing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[182]</span>“But it is impossible,” he said; “they will
be called for this afternoon.”</p>

<p>“Who says so?”</p>

<p>“Your dragoman told me.” He sucked in
his lips with annoyance at being forced to this
admission.</p>

<p>“My dragoman takes my orders.”</p>

<p>“He referred to your partners,” said Van
Ermengen with a touch of insolence.</p>

<p>“I am waiting for my partners.”</p>

<p>Now that I had started, it seemed much easier
than I had expected to assert myself. I had
feared Van Ermengen. Now I saw that he began
to fear me. I saw too that he was utterly puzzled
by my demeanour.</p>

<p>“But your bedroom, sir? It is impossible.
It will take a couple of Arabs all morning.”</p>

<p>“I will pay them.”</p>

<p>“If you will come, I will show you where your
cases are. They are quite safe.”</p>

<p>“I want them in my bedroom.”</p>

<p>“But think of the weight! They are too heavy
for the floor.”</p>

<p>“If that’s so, I will ask the English Consulate
to take charge of them. Will you be good enough
to ring them up?”</p>

<p>He darted at me the malevolent glance of a beaten
man, and gave some orders in Arabic to a porter.</p>

<p>“I will have my breakfast in my room, if you
please, so that I may count the packages.”</p>

<p>He bowed, and we parted.</p>

<p>In spite of the misery that still afflicted my
soul, I had a new feeling of self-esteem as I regained
my room. I had come well out of this encounter,
and felt I could depend on myself in the struggle
that must lie before me.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[183]</span>Before I had finished my breakfast Jakoub
was shown in, polite as ever.</p>

<p>“You have slept well, effendi? You seem
no longer fatigued?”</p>

<p>“I’m quite well, thank you.”</p>

<p>“The praise to Allah. You would have the
packing-cases up here, effendi?”</p>

<p>I nodded.</p>

<p>“But it is against the orders of the Captain
and the other effendi. Nasr Hussein calls for
them to-day. I must obey my orders, effendi.”</p>

<p>“You must obey <i>my</i> orders.”</p>

<p>“It is not in my agreement. It is impossible,
this.”</p>

<p>He was evidently prepared to defy my authority.</p>

<p>I stood up and looked at him.</p>

<p>“Jakoub, if those cases are not all here in one
hour, I shall send for the police to take charge
of them.”</p>

<p>I suppose he saw in my eyes that I knew all
that was involved in this decision, to Edmund
and myself as well as him, and realised that I
was determined to take the consequences.</p>

<p>He smiled as he had smiled at the official who
offered him the five pounds.</p>

<p>“Very well, effendi,” he said, and departed
with a salaam.</p>

<p>There was deadly fear of him in my heart as
the Arabs piled the cases on the floor.</p>

<p>Shortly after they had deposited the last one
a message came that Brogden Bey was waiting
for me below. I had forgotten his promised call.
It was another embarrassment.</p>

<p>I locked my door and went down to meet him.</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[184]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER X<br>

<small>I HANDLE A REVOLVER</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">IT was somehow a relief to me to find Brogden
in a suit of civilian linen. His exotic uniform,
and the tarboosh which etiquette compelled
him to keep on his head throughout the evening,
had increased his effect of a figure in a bad dream.
Now I could realise him as my old friend—and
keep him at arm’s length.</p>

<p>I answered his anxious enquiries by assuring him
I was well. But I intended, however, to remain
on guard over the abomination hidden in my room,
and I made use of my supposed indisposition as an
excuse for not leaving the hotel.</p>

<p>He, of course, wanted me to lunch or dine at his
club, to meet his friends of the English Colony.</p>

<p>I knew that Edmund and Welfare might arrive
at any moment, and the sweat broke out on me as
I thought of their walking in and finding me with
this man. And it was impossible to get rid of him!</p>

<p>Through all the gloom of my misery I saw, like
a golden thread, the humour of our being there
together, of my having in my hands the treasure
for which he would have ransacked Egypt. Of all
men he was one I would most gladly have helped;
up to last night. But now I must use all my wits
to foil him in his endeavour. I said the word to
myself, to “betray” him! Yet I too was on the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[185]</span>
side of righteousness. I too would stop the issue
of this poison. But the achievement of his ambition
would destroy my brother, and drag my own name
in the mire of disgrace. To deal uprightly was
beyond my power now, and there were things I
must learn from him.</p>

<p>We agreed that my indisposition must have been
a “touch of the sun,” a diagnosis which in Egypt
fulfils the same function that the familiar “chill”
does at home, and I decided that if I could not shake
Brogden off otherwise, I would have a relapse.</p>

<p>He wanted to talk about people and things at
home, and anxiety began to make me feel genuinely
unwell.</p>

<p>“Tell me,” I said suddenly, “do you know these
two Englishmen you are after?”</p>

<p>He looked round uneasily, evidently disinclined
to renew his confidences of the night before.</p>

<p>“No,” he said, “I’ve never seen them myself.
Not yet.”</p>

<p>“Do you know their names?”</p>

<p>“Oh, I expect they’ve a different name in every
port! They’re known to us as Montgomery and
Ringrose. Don’t for God’s sake talk about them.”</p>

<p>“I won’t utter a word to a soul. But I’m deeply
interested.”</p>

<p>“It is a queer business. Montgomery is said to
have the manners of a gentleman. The other one
is a regular old shell-back, I believe. Professes to
be some kind of sea-captain. They’re both slim,
though! By Jove, they’ll want handling.”</p>

<p>“What’s this drug worth? How much a
pound?”</p>

<p>“Well, one can’t say exactly. The actual buyer
would give ten pounds, perhaps, for a pound of it,
if he could get it. But of course the fellows who<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[186]</span>
bring it in don’t get all that. It has to go through
the Lord knows how many hands. If they can
dispose of it well, and in fairly big lots, they might
clear a fiver on every pound of it. They wouldn’t
take the risk for much less.”</p>

<p>Ten thousand pounds, I thought with horror,
was represented by the load in my bedroom!</p>

<p>“But don’t let’s talk about the business,” Brogden
continued, “it’s never safe. You never know.
I’m going to have a cock-tail—the one exception to
the rule of ‘no drinks before sun-down!’ Do you
mind coming in the American bar?”</p>

<p>I went with him and sat on a high stool by the
end of a marble counter on which were vast blocks
of ice with soda-water bottles sticking out of them
like spines.</p>

<p>Brogden went and busied himself in superintending
the concoction of some mysterious drink which
he averred was the only one suitable and wholesome
for the time and place.</p>

<p>Behind the bar and opposite where I sat was a
door which I knew opened into Van Ermengen’s
private office. It was slightly open, and through
the crack I heard Jakoub’s voice and Van Ermengen’s,
speaking in Arabic.</p>

<p>If they had spoken in English I could not have
heard all they said. As it was I could distinguish
only a few isolated words of which I knew the meaning.
I had no qualm of conscience in listening, and
only envied Brogden’s knowledge of the language.</p>

<p>It sounded as though Jakoub were urging something
and the other were demurring.</p>

<p>I heard the words “el moftah” (the key) repeated
several times, and then I recognised “a part of it,”
“our share,” and “to-night.”</p>

<p>I trembled lest Jakoub should come out and be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[187]</span>
recognised by Brogden, but instead there was an
exclamation of annoyance or alarm, as someone
hastily shut the door.</p>

<p>“Here you are,” cried Brogden, bringing a
wine-glass filled with an amber liquor with an olive
at the bottom of it. “That will do you more good
than all the medicine in the chemists’ shops! Good
health!”</p>

<p>“Good health,” I answered, tasting the liquor,
which was certainly very agreeable.</p>

<p>“I hate leaving you alone, old man. But I can’t
cut lunch at the club—or dinner to-day, and to-morrow
I have to go to Cairo for a day. When does
your boat sail?”</p>

<p>“I’ve not decided yet. I may rest here a day
or two in any case.”</p>

<p>“Then we shall meet again, and I’ll be able to
trot you round a bit when I get back.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I hope so. But remember if we miss each
other we must not ‘lose touch’ again. We will
write, and I’ll hope to come out next winter. And
you must spend part of your next leave with me.”</p>

<p>His going to Cairo was an unspeakable relief;
but I longed for an opportunity to make him some
amends. So we parted very cordially.</p>

<p>I got wearily back to my room and counted over
again the cases of hashish! They were undisturbed,
but I felt more nervous of my trust than if
they had been solid gold or dynamite.</p>

<p>I ordered my meals to be sent up to my room, sent
for some papers and books which I knew I should
be unable to read, and sat down once more trying
to plan out my immediate future.</p>

<p>One thing only was certain. I must remain
where I was until the <i>Astarte</i> came into harbour.
Then I must face Edmund. I felt how much easier<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[188]</span>
it would be to be the guilty one. What was I to
say to him? How were we to adjust our new
relationship? I was determined to insist on his
coming out of this life in which he had lost his
honour and his caste. I did not shrink from the
notion of impoverishing myself if necessary. But
even if I succeeded in restoring Edmund to his
caste, how could he take his place in it?</p>

<p>I knew that, as a matter of practical experience,
there really is no absolution without penance.
Knowing Edmund as I did, I knew that he would
impose the penance on himself, and refuse the
absolution. How was I to persuade him that all
the best of his life, which lay before him, must be
lived vigorously and honourably if only to make
reparation?</p>

<p>I feared the weakness and petulance in his character,
which I knew might drive him to shirk the
issue in a cowardly suicide. I determined that I
would hold him by the immediate plain duty of
getting rid of this present cargo of potential infamy.
I began to see in the hated packing-cases the means
of Edmund’s deliverance from himself.</p>

<p>About their destination I was clear and determined,
but as to how to get them there, how even
to move them from this room without exposure and
disgrace, I had no idea whatever.</p>

<p>Of Captain Welfare I thought little. In other
circumstances he would no doubt have prosperously
added sand to sugar like my churchwarden at home,
or have made an “honest living” out of poverty
as a pawnbroker. He belonged to the class whose
ideal is “respectability.” It would be wrong to
expect of such a higher ethical standard than their
own.</p>

<p>No doubt he had expected to retire on his share<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[189]</span>
of the profits of this infamy. Once I had seen the
stuff destroyed I would give him his pieces of silver.
He could just “put up the shutters” for the last
time and appear no more in his shirt sleeves.</p>

<p>The long day wore itself away amid my fretting;
but Edmund did not come. Once more I watched
the sun set across the sea and, with the darkness,
my fear of Jakoub revived.</p>

<p>I knew now that he was in league with Van
Ermengen, that they both knew I was an enemy to
their schemes. In my loneliness and sense of
weakness I wished that even Brogden were back.
I was in the enemy’s camp and had no means of
finding even one man whom I could trust. I
wondered about the fragments of their conversation
I had overheard. What key was it they
spoke of?</p>

<p>“A part of it—our share—to-night!”</p>

<p>I had not thought much of the words when I
heard them. I was not quite certain if I had their
meaning right, caught as they were in isolated fragments
of a conversation I could not understand.
Besides, my mind had been concentrated on the
fear of Jakoub’s appearing and being recognised.
But now, at the end of my day of solitary pondering,
they came back into my mind, and it seemed their
meaning was obvious.</p>

<p>The key must be the key of my own door. Jakoub
must intend to steal the poison from my room, or
at least as much of it as he regarded as his share—his
and Van Ermengen’s.</p>

<p>From what I knew of its value I realised that a
few cases of it would recompense him.</p>

<p>And the attempt was to be made to-night.</p>

<p>My dread of the man almost overcame me. I
longed to leave the place, to escape, and let him do<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[190]</span>
as he would. I do not think it was fear of any
violence he might attempt against myself.</p>

<p>I have not tried to tell what the loss of my faith
in Edmund meant to me. But I do know that I
would have surrendered my life then without regret.
Yet I shrank from the idea of conflict with this man.
I mistrusted myself and my own will. It was
exactly the same feeling I had had before my first
fight at school. I was then not frightened of being
hurt. But I was sick with the terror of finding
myself a coward and showing it.</p>

<p>However, I determined I would not desert my trust.</p>

<p>I got out Edmund’s revolver, laid it on the table,
and sat down by it to wait.</p>

<p>The night was hot and it was late before I heard
the voices and the closing doors of other occupants
of the hotel retiring. Had there been an Englishman
among them I believe I should have appealed
to him to share my vigil.</p>

<p>But they were all foreigners. I had heard nothing
spoken but Italian and a language I took to be
Greek. I could speak neither. To explain would
be impossible.</p>

<p>A clock somewhere struck one, and suddenly
the strain became intolerable. I reflected that
they would not come at all while my light was on,
and like a kind of vertigo came the desire to get the
encounter over. It was the same longing that one
has to throw one’s self down from a height. But
could I endure the waiting in the dark?</p>

<p>I decided that I must.</p>

<p>There was a switch attached to a long cord over
my bed. I placed it under my pillow. I turned
the key and took it purposely from the key-hole,
took the pistol in my hand, and putting out the
light lay down on the bed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[191]</span>I listened to my heart like a muffled drum within
me, “beating its funeral march to the grave.”</p>

<p>And then the one thing I had not contemplated
happened. I slept.</p>

<p>I awoke dumb with horror and the certainty
that someone was in the room with me; but I had
heard nothing, and there was no sound but the
“funeral march” within me, beating time.</p>

<p>I do not know how long I listened, but at last
came the unmistakable gentle sound of fingers
sweeping along the wall. It is a sound that would
wake no sleeper. But I can imagine no sound more
terrifying to one listening in the dark.</p>

<p>In a spasm of terror I pressed the switch and sat
up, covering Jakoub with the revolver. He stood
by the wall near the end of my bed. One hand was
in the bosom of his galabieh. He was not smiling,
but his lips were drawn back and his teeth bared in
a kind of snarl, the reaction of a man startled and
disconcerted by sudden fright. Fear was like a
third party between us.</p>

<p>“Put your weapon on the table or I’ll fire.”</p>

<p>I had not meant to speak, and my own words
startled me.</p>

<p>Jakoub hesitated. The revolver was not cocked
and I began to pull the trigger.</p>

<p>Jakoub could see the hammer rise. He laid a
knife on the table.</p>

<p>“It was but to cut the strings, effendi,” he said
with a return of his smile. I slowly relaxed my
pressure on the trigger, the hammer sank again,
and I cocked the thing with my thumb as Edmund
had shown me how to do. Jakoub watched me.</p>

<p>“You know what will happen if I pull the trigger
again?”</p>

<p>“I have used a revolver,” he sneered.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">[192]</span>“Sit down on that chair at the end of the table.”</p>

<p>He obeyed, and I took a chair at the near end.
I propped the pistol on a pile of books, so that it
was impossible to miss him if he moved.</p>

<p>“Why do you threaten me, effendi? I mean
you no harm.”</p>

<p>“Why have you stolen into my room at night?”</p>

<p>“I have but come for my property. You have
taken it from me unjustly. I knew you would not
give it to me. I wished for peace to be between us.
I am a very good, very peaceful Arab.”</p>

<p>In spite of myself I smiled at his remark, and at
my smiling I saw to my surprise a new respect and
fear of me awaken in Jakoub’s eyes.</p>

<p>It was as though he knew our Irish proverb,
“Beware of the front of a bull, the heels of a horse,
the teeth of a dog, <i>and the smile of an Englishman</i>.”</p>

<p>An immense relief swept over me as I realised that
fear had changed places across that table. I no
longer dreaded my own cowardice.</p>

<p>“Let me go now, effendi, and I will await my
share till the Captain come. It is now morning,
he will be here to-day.”</p>

<p>“If you move, I will fire.”</p>

<p>I was aware of an extraordinary feeling within
me. It was an intense desire to pull that trigger
and kill him. It was blood-lust. It had never
visited me before, and I felt it now as an intolerable
temptation.</p>

<p>Jakoub saw it in my face. I saw it reflected by
the terror in his eyes.</p>

<p>“Do not, effendi,” he moaned, and I pitied him.
The desire for his life faded out.</p>

<p>“In an hour it will be day,” he argued. “The
people will awake. If I am found here there will
be plenty questions. It is not wise, effendi!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[193]</span>I reached out with my left hand and took his
knife from the table.</p>

<p>“To cut strings only,” he repeated.</p>

<p>It was true that if he were found there, questions
might be asked, and talk might arise that would
ruin everything. I was at a loss how to end the
situation.</p>

<p>“Jakoub,” I said, “I know now what is in those
cases.”</p>

<p>“Of course the effendi knows. Are they not his?”</p>

<p>“No they are not mine. I did not know what
was in them until I came here the other night.”</p>

<p>Jakoub’s face told me what I wanted to know.
He understood it was a time for truth between us,
and I saw that he was surprised. He had evidently
believed that I was all along privy to the conspiracy.
I suppose his manifest contempt for me was due to
some idea that I was willing to accept less than my
proper share of the profits.</p>

<p>“I did not know what was in those cases,” I
repeated. “I did not understand that this was a
scheme to poison your own people and make money
out of their misery. I knew nothing about your
accursed trade. Now, I tell you, I know; and as
long as I live not one ounce of that stuff shall be
sold. I will pay you for your services to me, but
you shall not get one piastre of profit from your
drug.”</p>

<p>The man’s avarice almost overcame his self-control.
He started forward in his chair.</p>

<p>I raised the revolver an inch or two, and he sank
back.</p>

<p>“It is my property, my share of it. Even the
poor Arab cannot be robbed always. I have paid
for what I have there. I will see the Captain.
Who are you to take from me my goods?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">[194]</span>“I know the man who is hunting you, Jakoub.
He is very close on your heels. If I speak to him
to-day, you will be in prison to-night.”</p>

<p>“If I am, <i>I</i> speak! What then for you and the
others? We’re all in one ship.”</p>

<p>“I am not. I knew nothing of the business, and
I can prove it to my friend who is looking for you—<i>only
for you</i>, mind. The others can take care of
themselves. They have deceived me.”</p>

<p>I watched him closely to see if he believed my last
statement. I gathered from his look of discouragement
that he did. I suppose from his point of view,
there was nothing surprising in it.</p>

<p>“If you wish to see Captain Welfare again, you
may see him here, in my presence, when he comes.
I will let you live till then. I will not answer for
Montgomery Effendi.” He showed no surprise at
my mention of this name, and I hoped that perhaps
he knew no other.</p>

<p>“Have you complaint of me for him? Have I
not served you?”</p>

<p>“You served me well on the journey. I shall
not forget to say so. But he will be angry when he
learns what I know. You will not understand,
perhaps, but he will not be just. This is his pistol.
If he were here holding it now, you would be dead,
Jakoub.”</p>

<p>“I do not fear him or any man.”</p>

<p>“All right. You can go now. I shall not lock
my door. But I think you will not try again to
take your property. See, there is the daylight.”</p>

<p>I rose and opened the shutters. I had to risk
the movement because my forearm ached so with
holding the revolver that I knew I could bear it
no longer.</p>

<p>The amber light of morning filled the large bare<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[195]</span>
room, revealing the feebleness of the electric lights
which before had seemed so brilliant. They glowed
now as points of light without power to illuminate
anything.</p>

<p>Jakoub looked yellow-skinned and old. I saw
points of grey in his black hair that I had not noticed
before. I felt as if I looked a hundred years old,
and knew that whether he went or not I must sleep.</p>

<p>He was standing with his hands folded before
him looking at the ugly pile of packing-cases.</p>

<p>“Effendi,” he said, “it is many thousands of
pounds. We have worked hard and suffered much.
We have paid much money to bring it here.”</p>

<p>“Go away,” I answered petulantly. I was
rocking on my feet with the desire to sleep. The
man simply bored me now, like a guest that will
not depart.</p>

<p>“It is no good,” I added. “You cannot have
it. You cannot have any of it.”</p>

<p>“All my life I have dreamed of such a chance,
and now you rob me. Why?”</p>

<p>“If you don’t get out of this I’ll—I’ll ring the
bell.”</p>

<p>I was conscious of bathos in this threat, but somehow
the ordinariness of daylight made it impossible
to threaten him with the revolver. I was a clergyman
again, longing to get into my pyjamas.</p>

<p>Jakoub went sorrowfully out of the room.</p>

<p>I undressed and lay down, leaving the door ajar.</p>

<p>I knew there was something more potent than
gunpowder protecting me and my charge, and I
slept secure under the ægis of my own will.</p>

<p>I had overcome Jakoub and I was proud of it.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XI<br>

<small>CAPTAIN WELFARE EXPLAINS</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">I&#8202; HAD finished a late breakfast and sat trying
to forget my trouble and take an intelligent
interest in <i>The Egyptian Gazette</i> and an eloquent
indictment in its columns of the “Ministry of Wakfs.”</p>

<p>I was still at a loss as to the nature and functions
of this institution when Edmund came in, very
debonair in his white linen suit.</p>

<p>“By Jove!” he cried. “I’m glad to see you
here safe. We were terribly worried about you
when we saw the sand blowing—what is it? What’s
the matter?”</p>

<p>I had tried to keep all signals out of my face and
aspect, but I could not command myself. I knew
I looked a crushed and guilty man.</p>

<p>I saw the youthful joyousness fade out of
Edmund’s eyes as he turned and saw the pile of
boxes on the floor, and more than ever then I knew
how dear to me he was; how much dearer than I
suppose most sons are to their fathers.</p>

<p>He had wronged me deeply. How would it be
possible for him to forgive me? We pray to be
forgiven as we forgive them that trespass against
us. We dare not profess to forgive those against
whom we have trespassed.</p>

<p>He faced me again, but now with a grave, stern
face.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[197]</span>“Why have you brought all that up here?”</p>

<p>“I could not trust it anywhere else.”</p>

<p>“I see. You know what it is?”</p>

<p>I nodded.</p>

<p>“You understand, of course, that I knew all
along?”</p>

<p>“Yes, now. From what I have learned I am
bound to suppose that. I want you to tell me all
about it, to explain——”</p>

<p>“Explain? There’s nothing to explain. I did
want to keep you out of it. I tried, faintly. I
loathed the idea of your being humbugged—oh!
yes, that’s what it comes to. But I was too feeble
to prevent it. But I won’t insult you further with
my regrets. The other things are bad enough, but
I wish to God you could know how I mind about
you. Good-bye!”</p>

<p>He went to the door, and it was no mere melodramatic
movement. I knew well that if he went
it would be the end between us.</p>

<p>Very quietly I said, “Wait a moment. You
have no right to leave me in the lurch now. You
have got me into this hole. Even at the cost of a
few days’ unpleasantness for yourself, you must get
me out of it. Then you can go on with your own
plans for yourself.”</p>

<p>It stopped him like an expanding bullet.</p>

<p>“I beg your pardon. If there is anything I can
do ‘at the cost of a few days’ unpleasantness’ I
shall certainly not grudge them.”</p>

<p>“I’m glad to hear it,” I said. “There’s a devil
of a lot to be done. You’d better sit while we
discuss it.”</p>

<p>“Well?” he asked as he took the chair in which
Jakoub had last faced me.</p>

<p>I felt I had a much harder, much more important<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[198]</span>
contest before me now, one in which I should have
no aid from revolvers or other mechanical weapons.</p>

<p>“Under the circumstances,” I said, “I cannot
consent to your calmly clearing out and leaving me
with all this very incriminating stuff on my
hands.”</p>

<p>“You’ll have no difficulty in getting rid of it.
That was all arranged. If you had left it to Jakoub
and Van Ermengen——”</p>

<p>“I know that. It would have been distributed
by sneaks in spite of all we English are doing to
prevent it.”</p>

<p>“We English are fools to try to prevent it. If
you knew the people that take it!”</p>

<p>This remark depressed me almost more than
anything that had yet occurred. It gave me the
measure of Edmund’s deterioration. I was again
reminded of the bishop’s remark about becoming
<i>déclassé</i>. But I had not thought the process could
have led to this.</p>

<p>“We may be fools, as you say,” I replied, “but
it is our habit to be decent fools. That is cricket.
You and I cannot start playing pitch-and-toss like
street boys and obstructing the field.”</p>

<p>Edmund flushed a deeper red. “Why bracket
yourself and me?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Because we are brothers. We are both
Davorens.”</p>

<p>“I’m not. I gave it up ages ago. I’ve kept
the name out of it all right. Welfare won’t give it
away, and he learned my name before we—before
we both——”</p>

<p>“I know. I’m very glad you have kept our
name out. But that’s not the point at present. I
called you back to know how we are to get rid of
this stuff, to destroy it? I quite understand there<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[199]</span>
would be all sorts of unpleasantness if I called in the
police. What are we to do?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know. Unless you burn the hotel
down.”</p>

<p>“I can’t afford that.”</p>

<p>“There are so many people interested. They
would all be out to stop you.”</p>

<p>“You must find a way. You and Welfare. It’s
the only way you can get clean again.”</p>

<p>“I can’t get clean again, except in one way. I’m
afraid Welfare won’t see it. He’s used to being
soiled. And, apart from the profit he was going to
get, nearly the whole of his savings are there. There
are plenty of pious Englishmen whose money is
just as foul.”</p>

<p>“I don’t doubt it, but I can’t help your savings.”</p>

<p>“Mine? There’s no money of mine in it! I
don’t own an ounce of the muck. Practically all
that was left of my money went into the <i>Astarte</i>.
But of course that makes no difference. It makes
me feel all the more a worm. I was in at it, and
it’s they who lose.”</p>

<p>I suppose it was in a sense not a very essential
point, and yet I rejoiced exceedingly to know that
Edmund was not financially interested in this
wretched enterprise; not directly, that is, for of
course he was privy to it, and it was obviously part
of the business of the <i>Astarte</i>. I recollected with a
twinge that I owned more of the <i>Astarte</i> than
Edmund did. But then I was not privy to the
business.</p>

<p>“Who are the other people concerned?”</p>

<p>“There’s Jakoub, of course, and Van Ermengen,
and the other scoundrelly native who was coming
for the stuff to-day.”</p>

<p>“Well, there’s no use any of these people trying<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[200]</span>
to prevent our having the stuff removed and
destroyed quietly. As a matter of fact, the situation
is that I offer to permit its destruction. The
alternative is handing it—and them—over to the
police. You have got to act for me in the matter.
You must see them and explain. Then you must
help me to get it destroyed. And I must see it
destroyed myself.”</p>

<p>“That can’t be done in Egypt.”</p>

<p>“Then it must be got out of Egypt.”</p>

<p>“If it wasn’t for old Welfare, I’d rather you did
tell the police. But it would be terribly hard on
him. It was a fearful temptation, and I know he
tried to keep out of it. Better men than he is might
have given in.”</p>

<p>“I quite agree. It’s just because we’ve got to
consider Welfare that I propose this plan. You and
he must carry it out.”</p>

<p>“Yes; I see that. I don’t know if it’s possible,
but, by God, I’m glad to have the chance of trying!”</p>

<p>“Is Welfare here?”</p>

<p>“He’s in Alexandria, yes.”</p>

<p>“Well, you must see him. Tell him what has
happened and explain what he has got to do. And,
look here, tell him when it’s done I won’t see him
stuck. I suppose there will be some honest money
over when all your joint business is wound up and
the <i>Astarte</i> sold? Tell him that will all be his and
he can rely on me to help him in any straight business
he may take on. I know he’s an honest man by
nature.”</p>

<p>“It’s generous of you to say that.”</p>

<p>“No. It’s simply my belief. Try and explain to
him. Could you bring him here this afternoon?”</p>

<p>“I could, of course.”</p>

<p>“Very well. Then we’ll thrash the whole thing out.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">[201]</span>“Do you mind telling me how you got to know
about the infernal business?”</p>

<p>“Not a bit. I met the man who is hunting you
all down. He is an old Oxford friend of mine.”</p>

<p>“My God! What an extraordinary thing!”</p>

<p>“It is. An almost incredible circumstance. But
it’s the way things happen.”</p>

<p>“And you told him nothing?”</p>

<p>“He began telling me things, and I saw it all
before I let anything out. Even now I think I could
give him all this, and Jakoub, and keep you and
Welfare out, but I prefer the other way.”</p>

<p>“You couldn’t muzzle Jakoub once he knew his
own game was up. We are compromised utterly.
They would bring you in as a witness. They might
even arrest you! No, for God’s sake, let’s do it
our own way.”</p>

<p>A flash almost of fun came into his eyes.</p>

<p>“Do you know,” he asked, “that we’ll have to
steal it from Jakoub and the others?”</p>

<p>“I don’t care a hang about that.”</p>

<p>There was healing in our laugh, and I was filled
with a great thankfulness as Edmund went away.
I knew that for the time being he was saved from
himself. He had at last a clear, clean duty, and an
enormously difficult task before him. I could not
tell how he would accomplish it; but in the trying
there would be reparation. After all he had not
sunk so deep as I feared. He had tolerated
depravity in order to live the life he desired, but
he had not yet actually traded in it.</p>

<p>I was much more hopeful as I dozed through the
stifling heat of the afternoon, waiting for Captain
Welfare. They came at last about five o’clock.
Captain Welfare hesitated, or professed to hesitate,
about taking my hand.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">[202]</span>“It’s good of you to offer it, sir,” he said. “I
hope you’ll believe as I’d never have allowed you
to leave us when you did if I’d known such a storm
as that were blowing up. It’s the worst I’ve seen,
and I’ve seen plenty. When we got sand coming
on deck five mile from the land, I knew what it
were like ashore. I thought you were lost, sir. I
did, indeed. I didn’t think as you would have
stood it. Your brother will tell you how I carried
on about it.”</p>

<p>He paused, appealing with a look to Edmund,
who grunted as he generally did when Welfare
became eloquent.</p>

<p>“That’s all right. We had a rough time, but
now that it’s over I’m glad to have had the experience.”</p>

<p>“I wouldn’t have had you come to harm, not for
a million.”</p>

<p>It was evident that Captain Welfare was perfectly
sincere in his solicitude. I had no reason to doubt
it, for in spite of the deception he had put on me, I
believed him to have a regard and respect for me
that was none the less real because of his very
English pleasure in knowing one whom he persisted
in regarding as a “swell.”</p>

<p>Unfortunately he had the failing, so common in
his class, of believing it to be necessary to put all
the fine shades of his feelings into words. He
would leave nothing to the imagination if he could
help it. I feared he would drive Edmund quite mad.</p>

<p>“We had better have some tea,” I said, and
rang the bell.</p>

<p>“If you’ll excuse me, sir, I think I could say
what I have to say better if I had a glass of brandy.”</p>

<p>“Then for God’s sake don’t give him any,” said
Edmund.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">[203]</span>“Bring some tea and a bottle of brandy and
some sodas,” I said to the Arab. I was determined
to be just to Welfare.</p>

<p>“Now, Captain Welfare, I have asked you to
come here simply to discuss how we are to get rid
of all this poisonous cargo. I take it that my
brother has explained my views on the matter, and
what I have decided must be done.”</p>

<p>“I don’t know how to tell you what I feel about
it, sir. I’m a broken-down man. I’ve run straight,
or pretty nearly straight, till I let myself go into
this here. If you’ll believe me, sir, it’s not just
the money, though I reckoned there would be
pretty near enough for me to retire on. But I was
never easy about that. I wouldn’t have been if
I’d had it in the bank at home. I’d have known
the Lord’s blessing wasn’t on it.”</p>

<p>Edmund got up and went to the window. He
remained there, looking out across the sea. But
there was not a tinge of hypocrisy in Captain Welfare.
His God was horribly unjust in most things,
so unjust that, as I already knew, he thought it
necessary to fear him in the literal sense of the
word. But he would adjust his rewards and
punishments with a nice sense of commercial probity.</p>

<p>“No,” he continued; “what gets me is the
way I’ve treated you, sir, after all you’d done for
us. I can do no less than take it all on myself.
Your brother was against it from the start. I
only wish I hadn’t overbore him. But I never
planned it out beforehand. It came on bit by bit.
I honestly thought, sir, as we’d go to Guernsey and
back as arranged. Then when we got warned off
there was nothing for it but to carry on. You’ll
understand now it wasn’t only Jakoub was in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">[204]</span>
danger. Well, there’s times a man <i>can’t</i> tell the
truth, and we couldn’t then. I think you’ll see
that yourself?”</p>

<p>“Quite,” I said.</p>

<p>“Well, we deceived you then. It wasn’t the
first time, I admit. I suppose we’d been deceiving
you all the time. I was nervous at first, but if
you’ll excuse me, sir, it seemed to come natural to
you to be took in.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I’m afraid it did. I assure you I blame
myself very much.”</p>

<p>“Don’t do that, sir. For God’s sake, don’t do
that! All the blame there is is wanted. Don’t
you waste it where it ain’t wanted. Well, we had
this job on, though we didn’t mean to do it so soon.
But it come over me that if we could work you in,
it would make all plain-sailing. There didn’t seem
any harm in it. I didn’t see what harm could come
to you. But what I can’t forgive myself is them
books. Them books I showed you was false.”</p>

<p>This seemed to me a curiously minor point to
rankle so in his queer crooked conscience.</p>

<p>“I do wish now I hadn’t done that,” he added.</p>

<p>“It seems unnecessary to me,” I said. “It’s
almost the only inartistic thing in the whole process.”</p>

<p>It was an unkind remark, but it only brought
a puzzled look into his pathetic green eyes. It
made Edmund writhe, however, but then Edmund
deserved it.</p>

<p>“Between you and I, sir, I thought I was giving
you a fair chance to find us out. I thought you
<i>must</i> see through them books. You would have
if you’d have looked through them. But you never
did.”</p>

<p>“Captain Welfare, I might just as well give you a
Greek testament to read. I told you so.”</p>

<p>“Well, I don’t know!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">[205]</span>“I know you don’t,” I snapped, for this meaningless
exclamation always irritated me.</p>

<p>Captain Welfare looked so pained that I was
sorry I had snapped. There was a real innocence
about the man that made it almost impossible to
keep him focussed in the mind as the old schemer
he undoubtedly was. I was able to believe that in
showing me his abominable faked accounts, he had
actually been offering me a sporting opportunity
of finding him out!</p>

<p>“Well, sir, I’ve told you the story now. I’ve
acted bad and mean. I’ve not had the chance to
know many real gentlemen in my life until I come
to know your brother, and afterwards yourself.
When I was a younger man, and come to understand
what a gentleman was, and that I wasn’t one,
and never could be, it was a distress to me. I
always wanted to be with gentlemen, to work with
them and for them. Well, I got my chance, and
this is what I’ve made of it. I’ve brought your
brother into all this here. I’ve brought him down,
and I’ve treated you—well, the way I’ve told
you. I know now I’m not fit to have dealings with
gentlemen. I don’t mind admitting, sir, it’s a
disappointment.”</p>

<p>There was a depth of sincerity in his crude confession
that I think touched even Edmund. He
continued to stare moodily out to sea. But it was
evident he had been listening, and he made no
gesture or sound of impatience.</p>

<p>“Captain Welfare,” I said, “I told my brother
this morning I believed you were an honest man.”</p>

<p>“Sir, I thank you for it, though if you’ll pardon
my saying so, I think you’d believe any mortal
thing, as long as it wasn’t in the line of ordinary<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">[206]</span>
religion. Well, you know now I’m not an honest
man, leastways I haven’t been, but since you have
said that, sir, by God, I am! and will be, if I end
my days in the fo’c’sle.”</p>

<p>“Have you thought how we can get rid of all
this?” I asked.</p>

<p>Captain Welfare’s theories were rather embarrassing.</p>

<p>“I haven’t, sir. Not yet.”</p>

<p>“It’s got to be done.”</p>

<p>“Van Ermengen and Jakoub won’t let it go
without a struggle.”</p>

<p>“There are the police if they try to prevent it,”
I said grimly.</p>

<p>“They can easy square the police, sir.
Backshish!”</p>

<p>“They cannot square my friend,” I replied sternly.</p>

<p>“No; they couldn’t square him,” he agreed.
“But we’re not too well fixed for going to him
either.”</p>

<p>“I would much rather do it without him.”</p>

<p>“Even if we got it away from here I don’t know
where we’d put it. If we had it on board, I could
manage. But the <i>Astarte</i> will be watched every
minute she’s in harbour. They searched us for
Jakoub, sir, and for this little lot. Your friend
will have heard of it by now.”</p>

<p>Captain Welfare smiled, a regrettably unrepentant
smile. But many a man who has changed sides
has a temporary hankering for the old colours.</p>

<p>“You say you could manage if you had it on the
<i>Astarte</i>?” Edmund asked suddenly.</p>

<p>“Yes, if she were clear of the harbour.”</p>

<p>“Well, I see how it can be done.”</p>

<p>We both waited for his plan. He turned and
came back to the table.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">[207]</span>“This street is perfectly quiet from three o’clock
in the morning until after sunrise. If there are
any police about, a little backshish will keep them
away. There’s deep water right up to the sea-wall.
I’ve often seen feluccas tie up there. All we’ve to
do is to bring up a big fishing felucca, lower the
beastly stuff out of this window, load the felucca
and send her out of the way till the <i>Astarte</i> picks
her up at sea.”</p>

<p>It was a daring scheme, and its risks were abominable.</p>

<p>Captain Welfare pointed them out.</p>

<p>“You’ve got to take the risks because there’s
no other way,” Edmund said. “I’ve been thinking
while you’ve been talking. When you mentioned
the <i>Astarte</i>, I saw the whole thing in a flash. We
cheat Van Ermengen &amp; Co. instead of buying them
off, we hoodwink the police and get away, and we
can sink the stuff in as many fathoms as we like.”</p>

<p>“For that matter we could drop it overboard
from the felucca without bothering about the
<i>Astarte</i> at all.”</p>

<p>“No,” Edmund argued, “some of the crew would
talk. Jakoub will know what we’ve done within
forty-eight hours of their coming back. He would
get it up again if he had any clue to its position.”</p>

<p>“Besides,” I said, “I stipulated that I was to
see it destroyed.”</p>

<p>“So you did, sir,” Captain Welfare admitted,
“and that will be done as per agreement. So we’ll
have to get it on the <i>Astarte</i>.”</p>

<p>“Are you going to bring it all the way home,
then?” I asked.</p>

<p>“That is impossible, of course,” Edmund put in
impatiently, “we’ll have to get rid of the <i>Astarte</i>
at Marseilles, and then disappear ourselves.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">[208]</span>“Get rid of the <i>Astarte</i>?” I repeated. “Is that
necessary?”</p>

<p>“I’m afraid it is, sir,” said Captain Welfare.
“You see they won’t search us on the way because
they will think we are going to pick up a fresh
cargo. But we dare not leave the port in her
again. This friend of yours knows too much, and
he might get Jakoub while we are away.”</p>

<p>“I see,” I said, regretfully, “but I don’t see how
you will keep your promise about letting me see
this stuff destroyed—not that it really matters.
I’m quite willing to trust you.”</p>

<p>“I’ll not ask you to do that again, sir,” said
Welfare very solemnly, “you are bound for Marseilles
too. We shall have a day or two’s start of
you, but you will get there first. I promise you
faithfully you will see the last of the cargo.”</p>

<p>“Very well. But, by the way,” I asked, “what
was that cargo you landed at home? Was it
curios?”</p>

<p>“Of course it wasn’t,” Edmund said, contemptuously.</p>

<p>“I hope it was not more of this wretched stuff?”</p>

<p>“No, sir,” said Welfare, “there would have been
no use leaving that in England. That was ordinary
old-fashioned smuggling. Brandy and cigars as a
matter of fact. It’s done still from the Channel
Islands when a chance occurs, and of course the
<i>Astarte</i> was a chance. We had meant to get the
stuff through the Customs along with our straight
cargo somehow, but we had difficulties at Tilbury.
Then this tunnel of yours cropped up, sir. It made
the whole thing so easy we were going back to
Guernsey for more. Only this hashish business
got in the way, and we learned there was a warrant
out for Jakoub. Well, if they’d got the <i>Astarte</i><span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">[209]</span>
then, the whole thing would have come out. That
was why our agents sent to warn us. Getting the
<i>Astarte</i> back here without arrest was a fair masterpiece!
But, by the Lord Harry! it was anxious
work. You’ve little idea what I went through, sir.
And the course we steered—oh, my Lord!”</p>

<p>“Life was worth living for the time,” said
Edmund. “I often felt sorry you were missing all
the fun of the gamble!”</p>

<p>“Of course you knew all about this smuggling
at home, Edmund?”</p>

<p>“Of course! Don’t make any mistake about
that. I was in it for all the money I could put up
at the time.”</p>

<p>I sighed. The whole business was so very sordid.
But after all, brandy and cigars were not going to
poison anybody. The whole thing was stopped
now, and in face of the horrible traffic I had circumvented,
I was not going to break my heart over his
Majesty’s Customs Duties.</p>

<p>“Well, gentlemen,” I said, “our business now is
to get this load back on the <i>Astarte</i>. The sooner it’s
done the better. I suppose we’re all agreed to get
it away as suggested?”</p>

<p>“I agree as there ain’t any other way.”</p>

<p>“How long will it take you to provision the
ship?” Edmund asked of Welfare.</p>

<p>“I could do that to-morrow at a pinch.”</p>

<p>“Very well, to-morrow night we’ll shift this lot.
Let me see. All we want is a few fathoms of rope.
I’ll bring that up in a suit-case. You and I will
have to man-handle it out of this when Welfare
brings up the felucca. Half a dozen good niggers
will have it aboard as quick as we can lower it.
Welfare, you’ll have plenty of fishing nets aboard to
cover it up with. Then I’ll take the <i>Astarte</i> out<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">[210]</span>
first thing in the morning, and pick you up when
we’re well out of sight.”</p>

<p>So it was settled, and the scheme began at last
to look quite feasible to me.</p>

<p>“I wish,” I said, “we could dine together, but I
cannot leave this stuff unguarded, and it would be
awkward here if my friend Brogden turned up.
But, Edmund, I want you to sleep here to-night.
I was disturbed last night, and I’m tired and sleepy.
Anyhow, I’m a rotten shot with a revolver.”</p>

<p>I had to tell them of Jakoub’s visit and my vigil
with him, though I knew the knowledge of my
danger would hurt both of them very sore.</p>

<p>The things they said made me realise that I was
not insensible to flattery.</p>

<p>Brogden, to my relief, did not return that evening.</p>

<p>When Edmund came back to my room we talked
long together. But what we said I think concerns
no one but ourselves.</p>

<p>It left me happy in a new confidence that he
would be restored at last to begin an honourable
career.</p>

<p>The night was comparatively cool and I slept for
twelve hours.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XII<br>

<small>A MIDNIGHT ADVENTURE</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">EDMUND had gone when I awoke, but he
had left a note saying that he would be
back early with what he called “the fixings
for to-night.” He would remain all day, he said,
and I was to go out and leave all to him.</p>

<p>I was glad to be at liberty, for I felt as though
I had been imprisoned for weeks in the hotel,
and I detested the sight and the thought of the
place.</p>

<p>The Arab brought up a message that Brogden
was waiting to see me. I went down, feeling for
the first time prepared to enjoy his society, so I
agreed at once to lunch with him. He had a
car outside and wanted to take me for a run round
the more interesting parts of the city. I readily
accepted the offer; but I could not leave until
I knew Edmund was in charge, and so I invented
pretexts to detain him.</p>

<p>I took his advice as to the best boat to return
home in, and asked for an introduction to his
banker so that I might cash a cheque. Then I
insisted that he should again procure his patent
cock-tail. During this performance Edmund came
into the hall with his bag. He saw me with a
stranger and of course went upstairs without
noticing me; so I was free at last to leave.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">[212]</span>We drove at first among the narrow flagged
streets of the native quarter, which I specially
desired to see, and all the brilliantly coloured but
squalid scene, which seemed so commonplace to
my friend, had for me a wonder and a charm which
kept me silent.</p>

<p>It was too soon for me when Brogden said,
“I guess you’ve seen enough of this now—and
smelt enough. Now we’ll have a spin.”</p>

<p>We came back through the central parts of
the city, through squares and streets that might
have belonged to Europe, along the wide, smooth
surface of the Rue de la Porte Rosette, between
rows of acacias with flaming blossoms, and stately
tamarisks, past villas drenched in the purple of
bougainvillia, dotted with the scarlet of the hibiscus,
gardens with lawns kept green with infinite toil,
and blazing geranium beds, and so out into the
country among cotton-fields, orchards of figs and
vines and plantations of dwarf bananas.</p>

<p>Everything was new and delightful to me, and
the rush through the air completely conquered
the heat.</p>

<p>I had forgotten my companion and all my
anxieties in surrendering myself to the delight
of unaccustomed colours, when suddenly Brogden
said:</p>

<p>“Those two fellows are back with their damned
boat.”</p>

<p>“The two Englishmen you told me about?”</p>

<p>“Yes, bad cess to them. They’ve done me
again—for the time being. Only for the time
being. I’m bound to have them. For one thing
they haven’t a notion who’s on their track.”</p>

<p>I felt meaner than ever before. The whole
squalor of the business in which I was involved<span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">[213]</span>
came back on me, and seemed to take the colour
out of the sunshine. Yet I felt I must play the
hand through, however dirty my cards might be.</p>

<p>I was committed now to Edmund’s and Welfare’s
side, and I must learn what I could, even though
I should feel spotted with treachery all my life.</p>

<p>“What happened?” I asked.</p>

<p>“They got ahead of their time-table, or rather
my time-table. One of my picket-boats picked
them up only a few miles outside. The native
rascal I was after was not with them, and there
wasn’t a thing aboard that shouldn’t have been
there. I’m practically certain they had a big
lot of hashish with them, but they’d got rid of
it. Unfortunately there was only a native officer
in charge of my crowd, and naturally he got nothing
out of them.”</p>

<p>“And what are you going to do now?”</p>

<p>“Oh, of course they’ve landed their rascal
somewhere between this and the western frontier,
and he is pretty sure to have the real cargo with
him. He’s bound to make for Alexandria, and
he’ll bring the stuff on camels to some hiding-place
in the neighbourhood. I have every possible
track watched, so I’m bound to get him.”</p>

<p>“What about the railway?” I asked with
beating heart.</p>

<p>“Oh, no native dare put a load like that on
the railway. It would be stopped and examined
at once.”</p>

<p>I saw clearly for the first time how essential
I had been for the working out of Captain Welfare’s
plan, and I could not but admire the soundness
of his dispositions. I thought they showed that
combination of imaginative power and attention
to detail which is said to distinguish great commanders.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">[214]</span>
I remembered my first impressions of
Welfare, and how I had instinctively thought
of him as taking a lead in his line of life, whatever
it might be. Yet he had come to seem small
in his ways, and paltry in his aims. I wondered
which was the real man, how much the Welfare
I knew was but the product of untoward circumstance.</p>

<p>“What will you do about the <i>Ast</i>—the ship?”</p>

<p>I had almost called her the <i>Astarte</i>, and shuddered
at the thought of the consequences of such a slip.
To be found out now! unmasked as another
“renegade Englishman,” a member of the gang!</p>

<p>“I can’t touch her at present. I’ve no evidence
yet. I must wait till I get this damned Arab.”</p>

<p>“Supposing she sails?”</p>

<p>“She won’t sail at present. They’re waiting
till they get their stuff safely here. If they went
it would only be to pick up another load at some
place on the Greek coast, and I should take jolly
good care to get them on the way back. Nothing
would suit me better.”</p>

<p>We were back in the city now, and presently
we pulled up at Brogden’s club.</p>

<p>Here we lunched very comfortably, and I met
many of his friends and brother officials.</p>

<p>Everybody asked me if I had met so-and-so
in Cairo. I felt with embarrassment that my
social ignorance must seem almost uncanny. When
I said my time in Egypt had been short and that
I had spent it in sight-seeing, I knew I had utterly
lost caste. To the official Englishman in a foreign
country the only objects worthy of regard are
other Englishmen and women.</p>

<p>One elderly and evidently important person
informed me that he had been twenty-five years in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">[215]</span>
Egypt and had never seen the Pyramids. “And
I never mean to,” he added with a glance of mingled
pride and indignation. I had not seen the Pyramids
myself, but I felt it would be presumption on my
part to say so, a futile attempt to regain the place
I had lost in his esteem.</p>

<p>He evidently regarded the Pyramids as bad
form. I think he suspected Cheops and the other
potentates who built them of having done so with
a view to attracting the undesirable tourists of a
dim future. He might have dined with Cheops
himself, had that been possible, but he was not
one of those who could be expected to be amused
by the remains of a pyramid. Was he not high
in the Ministry of Finance, and decorated by a
grateful Sovereign with the Order of the Bath
as a reward for that magnificent inaccessibility to
ideas which makes the British Official so universally
loved and respected.</p>

<p>“No, sir,” he puffed, “no Pyramids for me,
thank you.”</p>

<p>I did not think highly of this particular person,
but the rest were very pleasant fellows, and Brogden
was one of them. I was an outsider to them,
and I was careful and troubled about many things
at the moment. I could not enjoy their society as
I would have done had they been my guests in
my own vicarage. I desired very ardently to get
away from them.</p>

<p>From the instinct of ordinary politeness, I tried
to conceal this desire, but I fear that I failed.
Anyhow, Brogden got up and said we must go
and see his banker and the shipping agents.</p>

<p>I know I left that club with the reputation
of a bore and a bit of a nuisance, but I console
myself by reflecting that I was quite forgotten<span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">[216]</span>
in five minutes. All the same I felt I had inflicted
a further injury on the much-wronged Brogden.
He had paid me the compliment of introducing
me to his own little coterie in his favourite club.
When one does that for a friend, one likes that
friend to be a success. Among middle-aged men
this is rarely possible. No doubt this is why
our clubs at home debar the introduction of strange
guests into the rooms frequented by members.
I had not been a success, and as we went down
in the lift I appreciated for the first time the profound
knowledge of human nature that would
prevent my taking Brogden into any room in
my own club except one that suggests the waiting-room
of a long-deceased dentist.</p>

<p>The fact is that an old friend, however valued,
is apt to be a nuisance when he suddenly emerges
from the Past and bursts in on the routine of the
Present. In spite of his cordiality, I could not
help knowing that Brogden wanted to be back
among his friends of to-day, and at his usual rubber
of auction.</p>

<p>Accordingly when our business was finished, I
made excuses for getting away, and he let me go
with shame-faced willingness.</p>

<p>I found Edmund busy with a block and tackle
arrangement he had slung to one of the bedposts,
and watched him in some surprise.</p>

<p>“We can lower six cases at a time with this,”
he said. “I’m going to make a pair of shears out
of a couple of these iron bedposts and make them
fast over the bit of balcony outside the window.
I reckon we shall be able to shift the lot in half
an hour; quite as quickly as they will load it.
I hope Welfare has got the felucca all right. Did
you get rid of your pal?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">[217]</span>“I did. He’s fixed up for the evening at his
club.”</p>

<p>“Good. He knows about the <i>Astarte</i> being in, I
suppose?”</p>

<p>“Yes; he told me all about it, and about searching
her. He guesses Jakoub was landed just about
where we did land. He is having all the routes
to Alexandria watched.”</p>

<p>“Poor devil! Is he a decent chap?”</p>

<p>“He is, very.”</p>

<p>“It’s rotten having to let him down.”</p>

<p>“Of course it is. But the whole thing is rotten,”
I said wearily.</p>

<p>“You still think this is the best scheme?”</p>

<p>“It is. Please don’t let us discuss it again.
The alternative is unthinkable.”</p>

<p>“What is he doing about the <i>Astarte</i>?”</p>

<p>“Nothing. He has no evidence at present. I
asked him what he would do if she sailed? He
said, ‘She won’t sail. If she did it would be
only to pick up another cargo, and he would have
her then.’”</p>

<p>“I believe,” said Edmund, “he would have
had us all right in the end—only for you.”</p>

<p>“Edmund,” I said after a long pause, “what
about Jakoub?”</p>

<p>“Jakoub is at present our only risk. Fortunately
he doesn’t know our name. Nobody
knows that, but of course he could identify us.
He can’t give us away unless he’s caught and done
for himself, then of course he would. I don’t
think he will be caught, but if not he will try
blackmail.”</p>

<p>I shuddered at the thought of spending the
rest of my life under the threats of this man. I
remembered the impulse I had felt to shoot him,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">[218]</span>
and dreaded the possibility of being subjected to
such a temptation again.</p>

<p>“Couldn’t you take him home with you?”</p>

<p>“He wouldn’t come. And what could we do with
him if he did? It would only make it easier
for him to start his blackmailing. He’ll probably
want to get to England in any case, and there’s
no use our giving him a passage!”</p>

<p>A note came from Captain Welfare announcing
that the <i>Astarte</i> would be ready to start in the
morning, and that he would meet us with the
felucca as arranged. He was too busy to join us
then.</p>

<p>“He must have had a heavy day,” I said.</p>

<p>“Yes,” agreed Edmund. “It’s not everyone
could have done it. But I must say for Welfare
he’s a worker. Nothing will stop him when he’s
fairly on a job.”</p>

<p>I am myself naturally very deficient in energy,
and so perhaps have an exaggerated respect for
it in other people. I detest the photographs one
sometimes sees of raucous politicians declaiming
with wide-open mouths, uplifted fists, and over-developed
facial muscles. To many, I know,
such men are the type of energy and what they
call “efficiency.” The men whom I have worshipped,
whose names I have seldom known, are
those who have made great roads and bridges in
remote places, who have conceived ships and mighty
engines, and the few god-like ones who have written
the great books of the world.</p>

<p>Between such men and myself there is a great
gulf fixed; but between me and the loud-voiced
politician there is only my own fastidiousness.</p>

<p>Some of this nobler energy Captain Welfare
possessed in his degree. His intelligence was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">[219]</span>
of quite a high order; he had the face and aspect
of a man intended for doing things on a large scale;
he had the simplicity and lovableness of a great
man, and he was unhampered by what we call
“higher education.”</p>

<p>Yet beyond escaping from the dry-salter’s shop
he had done nothing with his life. He had seen
men and cities, but he had not known them;
he had certainly not commanded them. Had he
succeeded in his first primitive ambition of making
money, it might have been replaced by a nobler
one, and in that he would have succeeded too.
But he had failed. Poking about amid adversity
he had done “shady” things; he had done this
one blindly dishonourable thing. But successful
men, who have the choice of avoiding dishonour,
have done far worse things, and I believed that as a
successful, happy man, Welfare would have done
nothing base.</p>

<p>What is the flaw in such men as this, these
many men who ought to bequeath something to
their race? Is it all the bishop’s “want of opportunity”?
Was Edmund also to become one of
them? That was to me the most poignant question.</p>

<p>As there was no chance of Brogden’s returning
we ventured to lock the door of our room and dine
together downstairs. But it was not a festive
meal.</p>

<p>The cloud of anxiety for the enterprise in hand
was dark over us, and beyond that the sky of the
future looked gloomy enough. There was the
threat of Jakoub’s malevolence and, more serious
to me, the question of Edmund’s eventual future.</p>

<p>I tried to get him to talk of this, but it was
as though he could not see himself apart from
the associations of his past.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">[220]</span>“How can I get rid of it?” he asked. “I
am only avoiding exposure now for your sake—and
the family name. Otherwise I believe I
should feel better if I went through the mill and
took what I have earned; prison for a bit, and
then the fo’c’sle for the rest of my time. It would
be a way of disappearing, and that’s all I want now.”</p>

<p>“Naturally; but you have no right to think
only of what you want,” I said, “you are wanted
yourself.”</p>

<p>“Yes, by the police!”</p>

<p>“Don’t scoff just now, old boy. Your services
are wanted. I know you have capacities that
have never been used, never touched. The plain
fact of the matter is that up to now you have
lived and acted as a boy—amusing yourself. I
don’t want to rub it in, but now you have got to
make up for it by giving a man’s work to the world
while you can.”</p>

<p>“How can I? What can I do? I can do
nothing but sail a ship. Ten thousand old duffers
can do that better.”</p>

<p>“There is just one thing you can do that everyone
cannot do. You can command.”</p>

<p>All men like to be told they are capable of command,
and Edmund did not question my statement.</p>

<p>“Much chance I have now of commanding
anything or anybody,” was all he said.</p>

<p>“Remember you come of the officer class,” I
said. “We have ceased to be a ruling class.
I know it’s old-fashioned even to think we are a
class. The vulgar call it ‘snobbish.’ But heredity
remains a law of Nature, and democracy is only
an invention of man.”</p>

<p>“I don’t see that social theories are going to
help us much just now.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">[221]</span>“Then I’ll come down to hard facts. However
wrong and corrupt it may be, we are still
to some extent a privileged class. And owing
to that fact you can still get a fresh start, which,
to be perfectly frank, a plebeian could not get.”</p>

<p>“How do you mean?” he asked with an eagerness
that greatly encouraged me.</p>

<p>I told him then of the bishop’s suggestion about
the Colonial Service.</p>

<p>Edmund made no reply. He was leaning his
elbows on the table, balancing a spoon on the
edge of a knife. The spoon see-sawed dangerously,
and I watched it in an agony lest it should fall.
It seemed as though our fate somehow depended
on its equilibrium.</p>

<p>It swung slowly to a balance and came to rest.</p>

<p>“Do you think,” Edmund asked, watching the
spoon, “that the bishop would still do that, or
try to do it, if he knew all this business?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know. He will have to be told first.”</p>

<p>“Of course.”</p>

<p>“I shall tell him the whole story. Would
you refuse such an offer if it came to you?” I
asked, fearful that my voice had betrayed my
eagerness.</p>

<p>He laid the spoon carefully down on the table
and withdrew the knife.</p>

<p>“No,” he said, “I should not refuse it, after
what you have said.”</p>

<p>I had gained all that I wanted, and much more
than I could have expected so soon. There was
no more to be said and no excuse for our lingering
at the table.</p>

<p>We went out into the lounge to drink our coffee,
both looking at English illustrated papers a fortnight
old. Their dullness seemed intolerable in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">[222]</span>
this weary gap of inactivity that had to be lived
through before the time came for our final risk.</p>

<p>“I can’t stand this any longer,” said Edmund
suddenly, throwing down a sheet of snapshots of
advertising peeresses at race-meetings, foolishly
photographed in the awful ungainliness which the
camera reveals in the act of walking.</p>

<p>“Let’s go out and walk or drive somewhere.”</p>

<p>“We can’t both leave. It’s not safe,” I reminded
him.</p>

<p>I persuaded him to go out alone, for I felt I
could better endure the irksomeness without him.</p>

<p>I returned to my room and sat by the window
looking out over the sea, and listening to the sound
of its waves on the sea-wall. The sound of the
sea is always soothing and always melancholy,
but it is especially so in distant places, for the
sea has but one voice, everywhere its murmur
is the same that we hear at home.</p>

<p>Edmund came in about midnight, and we sat
together in the dark by the window.</p>

<p>Next door to the hotel there was a café, and
its chairs and tables were spread out over the
wide footpath. We could see under its electric
lights the tops and tassels of tarbooshes, and the
white discs of straw hats whose owners sat sipping
coffee or lager beer, and eating olives and strange
sweets. Most of them were talking loudly, and a
strange babel of Arabic, Greek, Italian and French
came up to us from the pavement.</p>

<p>“I have seen the policeman on duty,” said
Edmund, “and put him all right with fifty piastres.
The street will be as quiet as the grave when that
infernal café shuts up.”</p>

<p>“It closes at one,” I said.</p>

<p>The moon, now some four days past the full,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">[223]</span>
was but newly risen, but star-light is very real
in Egypt, and presently we could just make out
the pale pointed sail of a felucca going slowly
close-hauled to windward.</p>

<p>“That will be Welfare,” said Edmund.</p>

<p>“Isn’t he too soon?”</p>

<p>“He’s all right. He’ll go up to windward
till he sees the lights go out, then take the sail
off her and drift down here. I arranged to switch
the light on and off a bit to show him where we
are.”</p>

<p>All the windows on our side of the hotel were
dark, as the building fortunately faced on to the
side street. The company at the café was thinning,
and the guests who remained were calling for their
final drinks.</p>

<p>“It’s about time to get to work,” Edmund
said, “but I’m going to have a whisky and soda
brought up. It will look more natural to Van
Ermengen if he has any suspicions; besides, I want
it.”</p>

<p>“No, there is nothing else to-night,” he said to
the Arab who brought up the tray, and then he
started methodically to take one of the bedsteads
to pieces.</p>

<p>He took the two long pieces that formed the
sides of the bed and lashed the ends of them together,
crossing each other. From this cross he slung
the block he had been experimenting with, and
rove an end of the long rope through it.</p>

<p>I held the rods for him as he worked, greatly
admiring the sailor-like precision and neatness,
the economy of rope and of knots, with which
the implement was completed. He put out the
light and brought the whole arrangement to the
window, and in a few seconds he had all the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">[224]</span>
essentials of a jib-crane projecting over the balcony
and firmly lashed to it.</p>

<p>He knotted the end of the rope into a double
bowline (a bowline on the bight, he called it) which
just held six of our packing-cases securely.</p>

<p>“Now I think we’ve earned a drink,” he said
quite cheerfully, as he switched on the light again,
and filled a couple of tumblers.</p>

<p>“We shall have to work in our socks and move
about as little as possible,” he explained. “As
soon as Welfare is ready I want you to hand me
the cases. I’ll put them on the parapet and get
them slung. You must hang on to the rope and
take the strain when I get them over the side.
Then lower slowly. Do you understand?”</p>

<p>“Perfectly.”</p>

<p>“I’m sorry to give you so much of the hard
work, but I must see to the slinging myself. If
a case slipped and fell—well, that would about
close the operation.”</p>

<p>“I don’t mind the work,” I assured him, “I
only wish we were at it.”</p>

<p>“It won’t be long now. The café is shutting up.”</p>

<p>I looked out of the window. Tired waiters were
dragging in chairs from the pavement, and whisking
the stained cloths off the very tables at which a
few guests lingered, reluctant to leave. Others
were closing shutters with a rattle.</p>

<p>The moonlight was steadily increasing, and now
lit up the pink and yellow plaster of the tall shabby
houses that faced the sea between us and the
native quarter. It lit the minarets of a couple
of third-rate mosques behind the houses, giving
them an hour of delicacy and beauty which the
crude sun denied them. The lamps along the
sea-front paled, and the lights in windows disappeared<span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">[225]</span>
one by one. The last tram crashed by,
and a belated <i>gharry</i> passed with some shouting
youths in it. Then silence settled down on the
city as the moon raised herself above the buildings
east of us, and “with delight looked round her
when the heavens were bare.”</p>

<p>Edmund noiselessly nicked the switch up and
down three or four times, and lighting a cigarette
came back to the window where we waited together
in silence.</p>

<p>Presently a dark spot appeared on the sea to
windward, and soon we could see the felucca dropping
down-wind towards us. The big lateen sail
was stowed and she came slowly on. Not a word
was spoken as she sidled up to the sea-wall, which
hid all but the top of her swaying spar.</p>

<p>In another moment Captain Welfare with a
couple of natives was looking up at us from the
pavement.</p>

<p>“All right?” he asked in a whisper.</p>

<p>“All right.”</p>

<p>“Lower away, then!”</p>

<p>The first load was ready and we lowered it as
arranged. The rope ran noiselessly on the carefully
oiled pully. While the natives carried the
cases to the boat, we got another load ready.
Nobody stirred in the hotel. A <i>gharry</i> came
past at walking pace; but we heard it coming
and put the light out. Captain Welfare stood
close to the wall below us. The driver passed on
without taking any notice. He delayed us about
three minutes and made my heart beat unpleasantly.
There were just nine loads for our derrick; but
thanks to Edmund’s arrangements the whole
job was finished noiselessly and without a hitch
in less than forty minutes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">[226]</span>As the last load reached the ground Captain
Welfare whispered up, “Good-bye!”</p>

<p>“Good-bye and good luck!” I answered, and
without another word he went across the road.</p>

<p>I saw him clamber clumsily over the sea-wall,
and then the felucca was pulling out to sea. Just
as she got out of sight I heard the creak of the
halyard as they got the sail on her.</p>

<p>I came back into the room, exhausted and
streaming with sweat but happy. It was hard
to realise that this most difficult and dreaded
part of our task was actually over and without
the slightest mishap.</p>

<p>I thought of Pilgrim and his rejoicing when he
at last got rid of his burden. Mine had indeed
been grievous, and, like Pilgrim’s, it had been a
burden of sin, even if not my own.</p>

<p>“Thank God that’s over!” I said.</p>

<p>“Yes, it’s a good job it’s gone so well. By
Jove! how hot you are. Strip and have a sponge
down and get into your pyjamas. I must put
this bed to rights and pack the tackle.”</p>

<p>I took his advice and made myself comfortable
as he plainly needed no help.</p>

<p>“Now I think we’ll have our final drink. Then
I’ll have a couple of hours’ doss, and be off soon
after dawn. I must not leave poor old Welfare
too long in that beastly felucca. He won’t be
having a very comfortable time, I can tell you.
If those natives guessed what they had aboard
I wouldn’t give much for his life.”</p>

<p>“Good Heavens! I never thought of that!”</p>

<p>“I know you didn’t. We didn’t want you to.
But he has all ready to blow up the boat and cargo
if he’s attacked. He would run no risk of the stuff
getting back into circulation. Yes; on the whole<span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">[227]</span>
old Welfare’s part of this racket is one of the few
really courageous things I have known a man do.”</p>

<p>And I had never said a word to him! I had
not known!</p>

<p>“He’s as pleased as punch about it,” continued
Edmund. “He’s a sentimental old boy, and he
has a feeling that he’s doing something to make
up for the way he has treated you.”</p>

<p>“I shall be miserable until I know he is safe,”
I said.</p>

<p>“Oh, the odds are on him! Even if he has to
hold the crew off with his revolver! Those fellows
are easily cowed, and they know the <i>Astarte</i> is
coming up. The danger is that they may rush
him in the dark. Well, here’s luck to him!”</p>

<p>But I could not take it so lightly, and I was
certain that Edmund did not in his heart. I
understood that he had felt bound to tell me in
justice to Welfare, and now this anxiety would
overshadow all the others until the suspense were
over.</p>

<p>“You’re about done, anyhow,” Edmund said;
“do get to bed. You’ll sleep all right.”</p>

<p>“I think I will. I am tired, but wake me before
you go, if I’m asleep.”</p>

<p>“Shall I?”</p>

<p>“Of course. I want to say good-bye.”</p>

<p>The dawn had come and it was daylight when
I was awakened by hearing him moving about the
room.</p>

<p>“I shouldn’t have had the heart to wake you,”
he said. “Good-bye. I say, you’ve been a brick.
I wish I could tell you. Good-bye.”</p>

<p>And with this he left the room and went on his
way.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XIII<br>

<small>CAPTAIN WELFARE KEEPS HIS PROMISE</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">MY boat did not sail until the following
day, and I now felt a degree of mental
and bodily lassitude and exhaustion
that prevented my having any pleasure in the
prospect of my last day in Egypt. I suffered
from a profound nostalgia and craved only to be
home. I had the feeling that I should never
see my experiences in perspective until I saw them
from my own study. Much as I dreaded the
sight of him, I yet longed to see Jakoub, to have
a final reckoning with him, to find out at least
his intentions and know the worst; but Jakoub
did not appear, and I had not the faintest idea
how to find him.</p>

<p>I was very lonely and depressed as I gave notice
to the hotel people that I should leave the following
morning.</p>

<p>Van Ermengen had kept out of my way since
our last interview, but the news of my departure
brought him at once to see me.</p>

<p>His manner was grave and courteous as he
bade me good morning. “Excuse me,” he said,
“but I understand you sail to-morrow?”</p>

<p>“That is so.”</p>

<p>“Have you any instructions about the—ah—the
goods in your room?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">[229]</span>“No; I don’t think I have, thank you.”</p>

<p>“They cannot remain here, you know.”</p>

<p>“Of course not.” I fear I was spitefully enjoying
his perplexity and deliberately prolonging it.</p>

<p>“But you cannot take them with you.”</p>

<p>“I had not thought of doing so.”</p>

<p>“But what am I to do? I must have the
necessary authority to hand them over.”</p>

<p>“You won’t be bothered about it at all, Mr. Van
Ermengen.”</p>

<p>“But I will be, I must be! I will not hand
over the goods to anybody without authority.”</p>

<p>“You will not be asked to; it is all arranged.”</p>

<p>I turned away, but he came after me and caught
my arm.</p>

<p>“But this is my house,” he said, getting more
excited; “things like this cannot be arranged without
my knowledge.”</p>

<p>“It seems to me that they have been,” I said
coldly, shaking off his hand. “‘The goods,’
as you call them, are in the charge of my partner.”</p>

<p>“But he cannot leave them here without consulting
me.”</p>

<p>“I suppose not,” I agreed; “I suppose that
is why they have taken them away.”</p>

<p>“Taken them away?” he repeated.</p>

<p>I nodded. His look of perplexity changed
to one of suspicion, and then suspicious fury.</p>

<p>“But they cannot do this without my knowledge.
It is impossible!”</p>

<p>“Well, they have done it. You can go and see
for yourself.”</p>

<p>The man began to lose self-control and raised
his voice.</p>

<p>“But it is not legal,” he cried shrilly; “it is
robbery!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">[230]</span>We were in the entrance hall of the hotel, and
there were people standing and sitting about.</p>

<p>“Please don’t make a scene here,” I said. “It
cannot do any good, and it is unpleasant.”</p>

<p>He glared at me, but controlled his voice.</p>

<p>“Will you please to come into my office and
discuss this matter?”</p>

<p>“I see nothing to discuss.”</p>

<p>“But I demand an explanation. Some of this
property is mine,” he blustered. “It was in
your charge. If it has been stolen——”</p>

<p>“Come, then,” I said. “I will talk it over.” I saw
that if I refused to go with him there certainly would
be a scene, with, possibly, disastrous consequences.</p>

<p>He led me into the office where I had heard
him talking with Jakoub. There was a sort of
sloping counter along the wall under the window
with papers and big account books on it, and we
both stood by this facing each other. Van Ermengen’s
thin, knife-like face was eager and malevolent.
It would have frightened me once, I
reflected, but I had faced him before and had
the better of him. Now I felt a kind of queer
pleasure in the idea of conflict with him.</p>

<p>“I will have this cleared up at once,” he began.</p>

<p>“Certainly, that will be best,” I assented.</p>

<p>“I will not be played fast and loose with.”</p>

<p>“Not by me, Mr. Van Ermengen, certainly.”</p>

<p>“It <i>is</i> by you!” he insisted. “You speak of
your partners. They are my partners. But I
do not know you. I have no arrangement with
you.”</p>

<p>“None at all, except that I am responsible
for settling my bill. I think under the circumstances
I had better settle it now and change my
quarters.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">[231]</span>“It is not of that I speak, and I do not appreciate
to be mocked! I tell you I had an interest, a
considerable interest, in the goods which you insisted
to have in your room. You tell me the goods
are gone. Very well, I hold you responsible to me.
I will have my money, please, if I do not have
the goods. I will not be robbed by any damned
sham parson.”</p>

<p>“You shall not,” I said quietly. “I am rather
at a loss here in your country, but at home if you
wanted to charge me with theft you would only
have to call a policeman and give me in charge,
as they call it. I happen to know these things
because I am a county magistrate, as well as being
a perfectly genuine parson.”</p>

<p>“Damn you,” said Van Ermengen, whose temper
seemed to have gone; but who was as much
impressed by the word “magistrate” as the lower
orders still are in England, in spite of the degradation
which has overtaken the once respectable Commission
of the Peace.</p>

<p>There was a lull in the storm.</p>

<p>“I do not want your police,” he said at length.
“I want my money.”</p>

<p>“And I will pay nothing, beyond my hotel
bill, except through police or lawyers.”</p>

<p>“How did they get the stuff away?” he asked,
his curiosity getting the better of his anger. “Damnation,
they must have taken it through the
window!”</p>

<p>“I don’t think it matters,” I said indifferently.
“You must get any information you want from
them. As you say, you and I have no business
relations.”</p>

<p>“But I will have my money,” he spluttered.
“You will not leave Alexandria till I get it.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">[232]</span>This made me uneasy, because I did not know
what the man might do, or could do. But I felt
it was essential not to betray any uneasiness.</p>

<p>“I shall certainly sail to-morrow,” I said, “and
I do not consider it worth my while to change
my quarters. If you attempt to interfere with
me in any way, I shall simply report you to a
friend of mine as an importer of hashish——”</p>

<p>“For God’s sake, hush!” he exclaimed. “Do
not shout that word.”</p>

<p>“I have nothing to fear,” I assured him. “I
do not mind who hears me say it. When I came
here I did not know what the vile stuff was. By a
coincidence I learned all about it, and I determined
to stop your vile trade. I have acted accordingly.
You may believe that or not; it does not matter
what you believe. I made my friends remove your
poison and theirs—it was not mine. It will never
be sold. I shall see it destroyed. If you are
wronged you can take what action you please.
But I warn you, Mr. Van Ermengen, you will
not get a penny out of me except by process of
law. Now, if I am incommoded in any way while
I remain here, I know what to do. I have nothing
more to say, and I shall be glad if you will have
my bill ready for me in good time in the morning.”</p>

<p>“You will hear more of this,” said Van Ermengen
as I left his office. I thought it was rather a feeble
remark, but I feared greatly that I <i>should</i> hear
more of it, and that Jakoub would be the medium
through which I should hear.</p>

<p>It was a relief when Brogden rang me up and
asked me to spend the afternoon and dine with
him at the Yacht Club. I forgot all my troubles
while I held the tiller of his two-and-a-half rater.</p>

<p>Although we spent the afternoon and evening<span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">[233]</span>
together, there was no more said about the hashish
business. I understood that he must be at a loss
and would avoid reference to it, and I had no longer
any reason to question him.</p>

<p>Brogden saw me off at the dock the next morning.</p>

<p>I greatly dislike being “seen off,” but after
all his kindness I could not tell him so. Thus it
was that I, who had so strangely and unintentionally
stumbled into Egypt, left the land of sunshine
and mystery like any respectable and most commonplace
traveller.</p>

<p>The low line of yellow sandhills we had been so
long approaching a few days ago soon sank below
the horizon as the great steamer rushed seawards,
and in spite of the sorrow that had come upon
me there, I felt a certain sadness at seeing the
land fade from sight. I felt that there in these
few days I had had more of a man’s part in the
world than in all the other days of my life. I
knew that what I had done there would offend
many consciences more conventional than mine.
A legal phrase cropped up in my mind, and I
believed that I had “compounded a misdemeanour.”
I had certainly sailed “close to the wind.” But
I believed that I had saved my brother from
irretrievable disaster. I had done what I could
to break up a nefarious conspiracy, and though
I now saw things that might have been better
done, I looked my conscience in the face and was
not ashamed.</p>

<p>That evening just at sunset I saw a sail ahead
of us. It looked small and insignificant in the
distance, but a great hope came over me that
it might be the <i>Astarte</i>. As we overhauled her
she altered her course so that we should pass closer
to her, and I saw the leg-o’-mutton sails, the long<span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">[234]</span>
high bows and the bowsprit with its head-sails
“like a skein of geese.” I found myself close to
one of the ship’s officers as I leaned on the taffrail
watching her.</p>

<p>“What the devil is that idiot doing?” he said;
“she looks as if she wanted to cross our bows.
There’ll be some swearing on the bridge if she makes
us alter course!”</p>

<p>“She won’t,” I remarked. The officer looked
at me with surprise and some amusement. I
suppose it did seem quaint in a clerical passenger
to assume a knowledge of nautical matters. But
in a minute or two the helmsman let her away
again, and put her back on a course nearly parallel
to our own. The officer glanced at me as though
there were something uncanny about me. At the
same moment I saw a string of flags mount to
her peak. The officer got his glass on her.</p>

<p>“I beg your pardon. Can you tell me what
that signal is?”</p>

<p>“Yes; it’s ‘All well.’ I wonder who the
deuce they think they’re speaking, or what they’re
playing at, anyhow. She’s one of those little
Levantine fruit boats. But she looks cleaner than
most of them.”</p>

<p>A great weight was taken off my mind, for I
knew that Captain Welfare was safe, and they
had taken this chance of telling me so, no doubt
guessing I would find someone to read the signal.</p>

<p>We were rapidly overhauling the <i>Astarte</i>, and I
saw that our converging courses would soon bring
us within a few cables’ length of each other.</p>

<p>Already through my glasses I could recognise
Edmund at the wheel, and Captain Welfare holding
by the shrouds, directing the movements of some
of the crew for’ard.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">[235]</span>I raised my white helmet at arm’s length above
my head, but it was doubtful whether they saw
the signal; for already I was surrounded by a
group of curious passengers, all waving handkerchiefs
in obedience to that strange instinct which creates
a sense of excited fellowship between strangers who
meet and pass each other in ships or railway trains.</p>

<p>However, my movement was immediately followed
by a wave of Captain Welfare’s hand, and something
splashed into the sea and sank in the <i>Astarte’s</i>
wake.</p>

<p>The splash was repeated, and I could see that
the crew were heaving overboard the precious,
hateful cargo.</p>

<p>Captain Welfare was keeping his promise.</p>

<p>I watched the process, fascinated at first, infinitely
thankful to feel that the load of iniquity which
had so burdened my spirit was thus at last cast
into the sea and the <i>Astarte</i> purged of sin. But
very soon I was recalled to uneasiness.</p>

<p>The curiosity of the silly passengers around
me was excited by the process, and I still scented
danger in every trivial circumstance connected
with the nefarious trade.</p>

<p>“Whatever are they doing?” was the question
I heard repeated all around me.</p>

<p>The ship’s officer beside me came unexpectedly
to my relief.</p>

<p>“Chucking bad rations overboard,” he replied
to one of the more eager questioners.</p>

<p>“Those Levantine schooners,” he added, in an
oracular tone, as he turned round from the taffrail
to explain to his audience. “Those Levantine
schooners always load up with condemned bully
and other blown tins to feed their dago crew on.
Sometimes they drive it too far, and the stuff gets<span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">[236]</span>
into such a condition that nobody can live aboard
with it. Then it has got to be jettisoned. That
is what they are doing. Those fellows drew across
to us because they were frightened of a mutiny
while they chucked the stuff away.”</p>

<p>He closed his telescope with a snap and looked
round impressively, receiving the homage which
landsmen pay to the omniscience of the officers
responsible for their lives.</p>

<p>Thus was one minor wrinkle of anxiety smoothed
away for me.</p>

<p>The <i>Astarte</i> fell rapidly astern, and the setting
sun turned her white sails to bronze. In spite of all
that had happened I longed to be back aboard her.</p>

<p>“I hope,” Edmund had said, “that you will
always keep a warm place in your heart for her.”
I found I had, and that it would hurt me as much
as him when she was sold.</p>

<p>My blunder about “scrap price” had been
prophetic.</p>

<p>When I thought of the little familiar cabin of the
<i>Astarte</i>, all the pomp of the saloons and state-rooms
on the steamer seemed to me but vanity
and vulgarity.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>I was back in my vicarage. In my absence the
tremulous passion of spring had passed into the
suave splendour of early June. I grudged having
missed the pageant of April and May, for at my
age one begins to count the number of springs one
can still hope to see. I had rather dreaded my
arrival and the necessity of explaining things,
but it was made much easier for me than I had
dared to hope.</p>

<p>Travellers are often disappointed by the lack
of interest in their experiences which they find<span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">[237]</span>
among those they left at home. The fact that
they have temporarily enlarged the orbit of their
little swirl on this planet gives them a new sense
of their own importance. They are apt to look
upon events that have happened at home as trivial,
merely because they happened at home and not
in some other latitude. Until they settle down
again, they think of the people around them as
absurdly interested in very minor matters. They
forget that in them too distance had once annihilated
interest, and will do so again.</p>

<p>As always happens on such occasions, Bates
and Mrs. Rattray were much more eager to impart
information than to receive it, and for once the
returned adventurer was sincerely thankful for
this perfectly natural attitude of mind.</p>

<p>Mrs. Rattray had deemed the occasion of sufficient
importance to emerge from her own precincts and
welcome me in the hall.</p>

<p>“We were glad to get your wire, sir,” she said
as Bates took my coat and brought my scanty
luggage in.</p>

<p>“I was afraid you would be very uneasy,” I
said, feeling like a guilty schoolboy. “But I
simply hadn’t a chance to send word, and I could
not resist going on.”</p>

<p>“No, sir. It would have been a pity as long
as you were enjoying it. We didn’t worry the
first fortnight. But then we did expect to hear.
I would have been very anxious, only the weather
kept so fine I felt you couldn’t come to any harm,
only for them wild men on the ship, sir. Bates
didn’t like the looks of them at all.”</p>

<p>“Oh, they were really most harmless fellows.”</p>

<p>“How did you leave Mr. Edmund, sir?” asked
Bates.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">[238]</span>“Quite well, thank you. He is on his way
home, but it will be a few weeks before he gets
back. Where is Mr. Snape?”</p>

<p>“He is away for the day, sir. He told me to
apologise to you, and tell you he had made an
appointment with his Lordship. He thought it
better not to put it off.”</p>

<p>“Quite right. There’s no trouble, I hope?”</p>

<p>“Well, sir,” Mrs. Rattray explained, “they
will be very glad to see you again in the parish.
Oh no, not trouble exactly, but they don’t seem
to hold with some of his ways, I don’t know why.
I’m sure a quieter gentleman in the house I never
knew.”</p>

<p>The highest praise Mrs. Rattray ever gave to one
of my sex was to describe him as “quiet.” She
seemed to suspect all men of a tendency to sudden
outbursts of noise.</p>

<p>“Some of them don’t like his ritualistic ways,
sir,” said Bates. “There were none of the regular
sidesmen collecting last Sunday, and there has
been trouble because he asked Miss Reynolds to
be secretary of his new communicants’ guild.
She’s only been a year in the parish, and they
did not like the idea of a guild, anyhow.”</p>

<p>“All right, Bates. No doubt Mr. Snape will
tell me all about it. Now I must go and see the
pigeons till lunch is ready. Then I’ll have a walk
round the village.”</p>

<p>All was well in my pigeon-loft, and the young
birds were promising. It was a peaceful little
world. I sighed as I thought what a pity it was
that Christians could not make more allowance
for each other’s fads. Most of us are so terribly
anxious to close all avenues to the Kingdom of
Heaven except our own crooked little path.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">[239]</span>Among my parishioners in the afternoon I found
that I had to protect poor Snape from a widespread
suspicion of his being a secret emissary of the
Vatican. The other mistake he had made was
to start only three of his “organisations.” There
was thus much jealousy about the filling of official
positions in connection with them. I saw at once
that in a community as small as ours the only
sane method would be to start sufficient “organisations”
simultaneously to provide secretaryships
and treasurerships for the whole of the adult Church
population. I decided to do this, unless the existing
ones first died a natural death. I hoped they
would for so far they did not seem to have made
people behave better, but had been the source
of a good deal of envy, hatred, malice, and all
uncharitableness.</p>

<p>However, all this turmoil saved me from enquiries
about my own recent movements. They were
much too preoccupied to take any interest in
these, though they were, I believe, unfeignedly
thankful to see me back among them. I decided
to preach to them about Charity. I would tell
them that though nobody knew exactly what St.
Paul meant by “Charity,” for all his list of attributes,
yet we all knew exactly what was meant by
“uncharitableness,” and that the main thing was
to avoid the latter.</p>

<p>On getting home I wrote to the bishop. I
apologised, unnecessarily I knew, for my prolonged
absence. I told him frankly it was impossible
to explain this in a letter, but that I had many
surprising and painful things to tell him, and was
in great need of his counsel. I besought him to
give me an opportunity of talking to him as soon
as he could spare an hour or two, and added as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">[240]</span>
in duty bound, that it was not in connection with
the affairs of the parish that I wished to trouble
him, but that my distresses were entirely personal.</p>

<p>His reply was delayed a day owing to his departure
for London, but I will quote a part of it here. “I
could give you a brief interview immediately on
my return, but I feel sure from the tone of your
letter that you have matters to discuss that demand
more than this. If you could have me for a night
next week we could talk things over as of old.
It would be a great pleasure and rest to me too.
For the time is a terribly harassing one. I think
it is not at all generally known how fearfully anxious
the European situation is becoming. There are
many forces at work that appear to be intent
on war, and I feel that Satan may be unchained
among us almost any day. Do not, however,
speak of this at present, and if you wish to see
me earlier do not hesitate to come over to the
Palace any day after to-morrow.</p>

<p>“Poor Snape was over the day you wrote, and
told me of his troubles with your flock. I am
arranging other, and I hope more suitable, duty
for him. Dare I ask you to keep him with you
for a few days? I know he has to consider expense,
as he has got into debt, among other troubles,
purely through financing some of his own attempts
at ‘organisation.’ To paraphrase the Book of
Common Prayer: ‘He has left unpaid those bills
he ought to have paid, and paid those bills he
ought not to have paid, and there is no sense in
him.’</p>

<p>“You will no doubt have perceived that he is
one of those excellent, earnest idiots that are so
hard to keep out of mischief. But he is a lovable
soul too, and capable of great good if I could only<span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">[241]</span>
find the right sphere for him. I know you will
not mind helping me to help him.”</p>

<p>The bishop’s letter made me feel that, after all,
I did know what St. Paul had meant by “Charity.”
It was the spirit that could see the worst in a man
and believe the best of him, the love that could
recognise folly and succour it without contempt.</p>

<p>After having mingled so much with what was
base, and paltry, and mean, the thought of seeing
the bishop again was to me like mountain air to one
who had dwelt in a dungeon.</p>

<p>Snape returned in time for dinner, and after a
few perfunctory enquiries about my “trip,” as he
called it, he told me of his interview with the
bishop.</p>

<p>“I could see at once,” he said, “that his Lordship
was put out. He had a very worried look.
Somebody must have told him about the attitude
of the people here.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps he has something else to worry about
besides this parish.”</p>

<p>“Oh no! He seemed full of it, of the parish,
I mean. He spoke of nothing else all the time I
was with him.”</p>

<p>“And did he make any suggestions?”</p>

<p>“He was most kind, most kind; and very
interested, but——”</p>

<p>“Yes?”</p>

<p>“I don’t at all wish to be misunderstood, or
to seem in any way wanting in respect for his
Lordship, but I cannot honestly say that he was
very helpful.”</p>

<p>“I’m sorry to hear that.”</p>

<p>“No, I really would not call his advice helpful.
He seems to share your view that scientific organisation
in parochial affairs is not universally applicable.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">[242]</span>“Good heavens! I never said that!”</p>

<p>“Not perhaps in those words, but that is how
I have formulated what I understood you to say.”</p>

<p>“My dear fellow, I couldn’t have thought of
anything half so brainy. I was only afraid that
those sort of things wouldn’t work very well in this
particular parish. As a matter of fact, they don’t
seem to be taking very kindly to them, do they?”</p>

<p>“They need educating,” said Snape, quite
complacently. “At the start there is bound to
be friction. And, as you know, friction always
generates heat!”</p>

<p>He evidently felt that he had said a neat thing,
and laughed in the manner of a pious man making
an innocent concession to frivolity. I felt as if
he were beginning to hypnotise me.</p>

<p>“What we should do,” he continued with a
bland air of superior wisdom, “is just as in mechanics—to
find the co-efficient of friction, that’s what we
want—the co-efficient of friction.”</p>

<p>“What we want is lubricating oil, I should
think.”</p>

<p>“Quite, quite. Oh yes, we must have our
lubricating oil too, but at a later stage. We must
first find our co-efficient.”</p>

<p>He had a morbid delight in the phrase, a bubble
from the forgotten mathematics of his Little-go
days that something had set dancing in his brain-pan.
I knew it had no meaning in this connection,
but like most of us, the man did not want meanings.
I saw he would make a great hit at a clerical meeting
with his “co-efficient of friction,” and I felt certain
he was making a mental note of it for some such
purpose.</p>

<p>He surprised me, too, for although he had manifestly
made a mess of things in the parish his manner<span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">[243]</span>
had an assurance, and even an assumption, of
superiority, very different from the timidity I
remembered at first. No doubt that had been
merely the result of the shyness which mere
unfamiliarity produces in weak natures. It had
worn off now, and I liked him even less.</p>

<p>“It seems to me,” I said, rather brutally, “that
the friction is mainly about who should be secretaries
and so on.”</p>

<p>“That is merely a superficial manifestation of a
deeper spiritual unrest, I hope of spiritual hunger,”
he assured me. “It will be quite evanescent.”</p>

<p>“It didn’t strike me that there was anything
evanescent about Mary Gregson’s temper at not
being asked to be secretary before Lizzie Reynolds.”</p>

<p>“Of course,” said Snape with dignity, “if
we are to be turned aside by the vulgar jealousies
of uneducated young women, we cannot make
much progress on the road to spirituality, can
we?”</p>

<p>I felt it was impossible to argue with the man,
so I propounded my theory of multiplying guilds
and brigades and things. But he did not approve
of this either.</p>

<p>“No,” he said. “That would be to jump
from one extreme to another, which is always a
mistake. Just as in the natural world, so in the
spiritual, there must be a gradual organic evolution.
We must be content with small beginnings.”</p>

<p>“The thin end of the wedge, eh?”</p>

<p>“Oh no, pardon me!”</p>

<p>I chuckled. I had deliberately tried that wretched
old phrase on him. And the hackneyed metaphor
is so invariably used of something undesirable
that I was certain he would shy away from the
sound of it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">[244]</span>“Well, I suppose you told the bishop I had
given you a free hand in the parish?” I enquired.</p>

<p>“Yes, I had already written to him to that
effect very shortly after you left! I regret to
say that his Lordship seemed to advocate what I
can only describe as a policy of <i>laissez-faire</i>. That
is why I venture to say that his Lordship did not
strike me as very helpful.”</p>

<p>If I had had the bishop’s letter when he again
used that word I am afraid I should have thrown
something at him.</p>

<p>“And what about stopping on here for a bit?”</p>

<p>“Ah, yes. I fear that is now out of the question.”</p>

<p>I manfully repressed a great sigh of relief.</p>

<p>“The fact is, his Lordship wants me very soon
elsewhere. In any case, I hope I have started the
engine, and it may be that you will find it easier
to keep it going in my absence. I understand
there will be some ten days’ interval before I am
required, but I should not feel justified in remaining
here. I suppose I must return to lodgings for the
time being.”</p>

<p>There was a wistfulness about him as he said this
that made me feel mean in my gladness at getting
rid of him.</p>

<p>In spite of himself I feared that the comparative
comfort of my house had softened his ascetic
fibre a little. There was something fine, too, about
his immediate acquiescence in the idea of leaving
it as soon as he was no longer on duty.</p>

<p>“Why not stop on as my guest until you are
wanted?”</p>

<p>The invitation was an impulse I could not resist.</p>

<p>“You are very kind, Mr. Davoren. I have not
been used to very much kindness in my life,” he
said simply, “and I thank you very warmly.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">[245]</span>
To be frank, what you suggest would be a very
real help and convenience to me just at present.
But I hardly like to accept——”</p>

<p>“I consider it settled,” I said.</p>

<p>He went to his room early, and I was glad I
had asked him, for I felt my soul was in need of
some penance. Afterwards I was especially glad
that I had done it before I got the bishop’s letter.</p>

<p>I was at last alone in my familiar study with
silence, with my shaded lamp, with the June
twilight on the garden outside. I sat down, hoping
to find the perspective I had lost. But instead
I found only a new foreground; a foreground
of Snape and his absurdities, of the passions and
excitements of my parishioners. It was only as
in a mirage that I caught disconnected visions:
of the <i>Astarte</i> with her sails golden in the light
of the setting sun, slowly pushing her way along
with her cargo of iniquity; of the desert with its
hot bright sand and lilac shadows; of the rushing
terror of the sand-storm, and the pale back of a
camel moving ahead of me in the dark; of the
stupendous masonry of the half-buried temple of
a dead worship; of a sherbet-seller in the native
quarter of the Eastern city, with his flaming red
tunic, his clashing brass trays, his huge water
vessel and great lump of melting ice; of tall yellow
buildings draped with purple flowers; of a great
pile of packing-cases, a rope and pulley, and a
fearful trepidation in a man’s soul; of Welfare
sailing out into the night with the crew who would
certainly murder him if they guessed his secret.
Through every scene in the panorama stole the
sinister face and lithe figure of Jakoub. But
amid all this, myself I could not see.</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">[246]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XIV<br>

<small>BLACKMAIL</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">MY natural indolence prompted me to
settle down again in my old familiar
rut while I awaited the bishop’s visit
and Edmund’s return.</p>

<p>Snape’s presence in my home, however, effectually
prevented this programme. He was a discomfort
to me, constant and irritating as a piece of grit
in one’s eye, with the added annoyance that he
was ostentatiously trying to be inoffensive.</p>

<p>When I went to my study to cope with arrears
of correspondence he would follow me and sit
in a wicker chair which he creaked until he drove
me forth to my pigeon-loft. If he sat by the
fire-place he kicked the fire-irons rhythmically,
filling me with the dread of homicidal mania.</p>

<p>He could not read a book without saying “Just
listen to this” and reading a passage aloud, when
he would expect some intelligent comment from
my exasperated mind. During meals he expounded
the duties of a parish priest as conceived by himself,
and twenty times a day he thanked me abjectly
for my hospitality.</p>

<p>But I endured all patiently, for I felt that need
of penance which comes to all of us at times, and
felt that Snape had been sent to me to chasten
me.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">[247]</span>His chastening bore fruit too, for it stimulated
me to perform one more task that my indolence
would have postponed.</p>

<p>I shrank from returning to the shop in Brighton,
though it was a duty I had undertaken. The
shop was part of the iniquity, and the prospect
of re-opening all that business struck a chill through
me, like getting into a wet shirt.</p>

<p>To discuss the matter with Schultz was particularly
revolting, for he alone, of them all, struck
me as being completely abject and unclean. Jakoub
was at least a courageous scoundrel and had a
dignity of his own; even Van Ermengen was
probably in some respects a man. But there
was that about Schultz which made me think
of him as an insult to humanity.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, stimulated by the presence of
Snape in my house, I drove over to Brighton
and visited the shop.</p>

<p>Schultz received me with an obsequious reproachfulness
in his manner that covered a hint of possible
impertinence. His smooth, pink, waxen face, his
curls of the barber’s block, and teeth of the dental
showcase, all brought back upon me the feeling
of nausea I had experienced on first seeing him.</p>

<p>But now there was added to this a nausea of
the soul, for I knew that he regarded me, quite
naturally, as a party to his foul intrigues.</p>

<p>Except for these sensations I was indifferent
to him, for I knew that Welfare had power to
keep him harmless.</p>

<p>I waited while he served, and doubtless swindled,
a stray customer, and then went with him into
the little office behind the shop.</p>

<p>“I have been most uneasy,” he complained,
“at hearing nothing, at receiving no more stock.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">[248]</span>
For weeks I have expected the consignment from
Guernsey, and I have had difficulty in explaining
to our London agents. See, here are their letters.”</p>

<p>He took a file from a shelf and pointed to letters
from the people who I suppose were to have been
the receivers of our contraband.</p>

<p>I closed the file, and pushed it back to him.
“But they are indignant,” he continued; “they
have received only the first consignment; our
contract with them——”</p>

<p>“I suppose,” I said, interrupting him, “they
can proceed against us for breach of contract,
if they like?”</p>

<p>“Proceed against us?” he gasped; “at law?
Holy Virgin! Do you not know——?”</p>

<p>“Never mind what I know,” I replied; “at
least, I know a good many things now which I
did not know when we first met, Mr. Schultz.
There will not be any more consignments for
your ‘London agents.’ That business is at an
end.”</p>

<p>Schultz flashed at me a venomous look of surprise,
distrust and fear. His pink complexion
faded to an unwholesome yellow, as he sat down
hurriedly on the office chair, from which he continued
to glare up at me.</p>

<p>“At an end?” he queried. “But I do not
understand!”</p>

<p>“I do not know how to make it any clearer,”
I told him. “Perhaps you will understand me
if I say there is to be no more smuggling!”</p>

<p>“But I did not come here to sell what you
call knick-knacks! Anybody can do that. There
is nothing in it.”</p>

<p>“No? Well, the business will be closed down
as soon as you have sold up the present stock.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">[249]</span>
If it’s worth while you had better have an auction.”</p>

<p>“But why is this?” he persisted; “I lose
my job. Why am I dismissed?”</p>

<p>“Captain Welfare will explain all that when
he returns—if you care to wait for him.”</p>

<p>I added the last words in what I intended to
be a very meaning tone. They had the desired
effect, for any tendency to show fight immediately
faded out of Mr. Schultz’s countenance.</p>

<p>I then examined his bank-book and some other
records which I found in this case quite intelligible.</p>

<p>Rather to my surprise Schultz appeared to
have conducted the business quite honestly. He
had credited himself with nothing but his wages,
and not only was my deposit in the bank intact,
but the bric-à-brac had been disposed of at a
profit that seemed to me enormous. As the stock
was so low I decided to close the shop at once
and wait for Captain Welfare to dispose of what
was left.</p>

<p>I felt justified in giving Schultz a little money
over and above what was due to him. Then I
watched him draw down the shutters and lock
the door. I took the keys from him and he disappeared
with the confidence of those who are
always sure of finding some profitable form of
minor dishonesty.</p>

<p>I went home to a hot bath with ammonia in
it, for this renewed contact with Welfare’s business
methods had given me a desire for physical cleansing.</p>

<p>In a few days my penance ended, as Snape
departed punctually, smothering me once more
with his “earnest and sincere gratitude,” and
leaving in my hands his draft for the organisation
of a unit of the Church Lads’ Brigade.</p>

<p>And then at last the bishop paid his promised<span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">[250]</span>
visit, and I looked forward to cleansing my soul
by confession, even as I had cleansed my body
after the interview with Schultz. When I met
him at the station and grasped his hand again
I felt as Pilgrim must have felt when Mr. Greatheart
joined him. I was sure that the lions of
fear and mistrust would be cleared from my path.</p>

<p>“It is a long story,” I said, in answer to his
enquiry about my adventures as we drove home.</p>

<p>“Then keep it until the afternoon, when we
can have it in volume form. I dislike instalments.”</p>

<p>“Very well. But you look rather haggard
yourself. Have you been sleeping badly again?”
I enquired anxiously.</p>

<p>“Not worse than usual, thanks. I am all
right myself, but anxious, Davoren, as we all
must be. Europe seems to be steadily and deliberately
making for war and catastrophe, and
at home we have want of unity, lack of discipline,
loss of faith. For us Churchmen especially, the
time is perplexing and distressing.”</p>

<p>“I know,” I said with the old feeling of humiliation
at my own helplessness, my own failure
to take my share in the battles of the world and
of the Church, my own desire to settle back into
my little rut in life.</p>

<p>“I wish I could help,” I sighed.</p>

<p>“You do,” said the bishop; “you help me
more than you know.”</p>

<p>There was a long silence, full of gratitude on
my part, as I got my horse into his stride along
a level stretch of the coast-road, while the bishop
leaned back in his seat, enjoying the pleasing
swing of the dog-cart, so much dearer to both
of us than the fussy impetuosity of a motor-car,
the true symbol of this age of blatant hurry.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">[251]</span>“By the way,” Parminter asked suddenly,
“where is your brother now?”</p>

<p>“Somewhere between here and Marseilles, unless
the <i>Astarte</i> has not reached port yet. I have
not heard.”</p>

<p>There was a constraint in my voice which the
bishop must have noticed.</p>

<p>“But you expect him back?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Oh yes. He will come here as soon as he
can.”</p>

<p>“Well, you must let me know when he arrives.
I have seen my friend at the Colonial Office, and
I think your brother is the very man they are
looking for.”</p>

<p>I felt my face burning as I replied, “You must
hear all my story first, before you recommend
him for any post.”</p>

<p>The bishop looked round sharply into my face.</p>

<p>“Oh? Very well,” he said, as we drove up
to the door and the conversation was cut short
in the bustle of arrival.</p>

<p>It was not until we went for our favourite ramble
over the Downs that I got my story told.</p>

<p>Since our last walk there the brilliance of the
first new blades of grass had faded, and on the
higher slopes there were already some of the browns
and yellows of summer, but all the flowers of the
field smiled up at us in the heyday of their reproduction,
and there were sombre patches of the
chocolate-coloured clover that grows there.</p>

<p>I started my narrative and gave the bare facts
of the case right through to the end, the bishop
asking a question now and then which helped to
set things straight in his mind and my own.</p>

<p>Never in trying to think it over had I been
able to go straight through like this. My mind<span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">[252]</span>
had always been diverted into side issues of what
might have been, what I ought to have done or
said. But now as I told the story to my friend
I began to see it straight myself, to appreciate
the degrees of blame in all concerned.</p>

<p>Before I had come to the end of the story we
were again sitting together looking down on the
cool, still mystery of the dew-pond, and the footprints
of the last generation of sheep around it.</p>

<p>When I had finished, the bishop said, “What
a blessing it is you went!”</p>

<p>“I am very glad you think that,” I said with
a deep feeling of thankfulness for his words. “I
feel that I was such an innocent ass.”</p>

<p>“There are some worse things than innocence,”
he replied, then added very gravely, laying his
hand on my knee, “My friend, I think that, as
you would say yourself, you behaved very well.”</p>

<p>I have never received any praise, even in boyhood
days when one longs for praise, that so filled my
heart with gratitude as this.</p>

<p>“I am very proud that you can approve,” I
said, and we left that subject by mutual consent.</p>

<p>We both sat thinking for a time, and then he
said, “I can see no good reason why your brother
should not serve the Government, if——”</p>

<p>“Thank God for that,” I broke in.</p>

<p>“Yes, I think we ought to thank God for it.
At the same time, badly as he has acted—he has
acted badly you know?”</p>

<p>“I know it. So does he.”</p>

<p>“I am glad he feels it. I was going to say,”
he continued, “that we must not take it all too
seriously. I think his is simply a case of delayed
development.”</p>

<p>“I don’t know that I quite understand.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">[253]</span>“Some of the best of men take the longest
time to grow up, like trees. There are oaks and
cabbages among men—a terrible lot of cabbages!
So a prolonged boyhood may be a good thing.
It is far too short in most of us. But of course
there are limits. Your brother has been so thwarted,
punished no doubt in lots of ways that we know
nothing of, for many things he perhaps knew
were not his fault. I see in him an embittered
schoolboy with the intellect and appetites of
a man. He will know dirt now when he sees
it afar off, better than his contemporaries, and
he will hate it even more.”</p>

<p>“But supposing, as I greatly fear, that there
is more trouble, supposing this Jakoub is arrested
and denounces him?”</p>

<p>“Then we must take Mr. Bumble’s view of
the law, and do all in our power to circumvent
it.”</p>

<p>“You would agree to that?”</p>

<p>“Of course I should. Any reasoning being
must. Law is necessary, and in England it is
generally just. But special circumstances may
arise in which Law is inapplicable, in which it
becomes an organised stupidity. Men of good
conscience must have courage to recognise such
circumstances and act righteously, whether they
act legally or not. So this existing reprehensible
person must disappear, and your brother must
reappear.”</p>

<p>“I see that,” I assented. “By the way, what
about Welfare?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know yet. He is a much more difficult
problem in psychology. But that was a splendid
thing he did, going off alone in the felucca. You
think he would have sunk it if necessary?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">[254]</span>“I’m certain of it. I trust him—now.”</p>

<p>“Well, I think he has redeemed himself. Yes,
we must help him too. I should like to see your
brother again. Do you think he would dislike
meeting me under the circumstances?”</p>

<p>“On the contrary, I know he desires, just as
I did myself, to see you and tell you everything.
In fact to confess, and, if it may be, to receive
absolution.”</p>

<p>“It is a natural and proper human need, that
desire to be assured of ‘the absolution and remission
of sins.’ But after all you are as well qualified
as I am to pronounce it.”</p>

<p>“Edmund will want to hear it from you,” I
insisted.</p>

<p>“Well, I shall be glad to see him. You must
let me know when he comes. I should like a long
evening with both of you. If Welfare can be
there as well, so much the better. I shall want
to explain to your brother about this Colonial
Office job, which I hope he will accept. They
want a man to organise and manage a small steamboat
service on Lake Nyassa. It is a good climate,
and much of the work will be congenial to your
brother. They have at present nobody else especially
qualified. I think if your brother asked
for Welfare as an assistant there would be no
difficulty about arranging that, and he would be
useful on the commercial side.”</p>

<p>“My dear bishop,” I exclaimed, “it is ideal!
How can I or Edmund thank you?”</p>

<p>“You know there is no need for that. It is
an interesting country, and the pay is fair. It
is a land full of opportunities for such a man as
your brother. Above all he will be doing some
real useful work for his country.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">[255]</span>“And,” I added, “he will be out of Jakoub’s
clutches once he gets there.”</p>

<p>“Yes, Jakoub will only be able to threaten
<i>you</i>. And as long as he is at liberty I cannot
see that you need fear him.”</p>

<p>By the time we reached home we had said all
we needed to say about these matters. The bishop
is not one of those who repeat the same thing
over and over again, and call it “discussing the
situation.”</p>

<p>So we were able to spend a happy evening together
in the sixth century, forgetting even the brief
pyrexia of modern Europe.</p>

<p>It was with a clear feeling of well-being that
I came down the next morning to meet the summer
sun that shone in through the open window with
a scent of wallflowers which mingled agreeably
with the faint fragrances proper to an English
breakfast.</p>

<p>It was above all pleasant to see the bishop
coming up the red garden path, bare-headed, a
towel round his neck, fresh from the morning
swim he loved, still lithe and athletic-looking
as in his undergraduate days.</p>

<p>While I waited for him to complete his toilet
I took up the pile of letters lying on the sideboard,
and saw with a painful start one in an unknown
handwriting with an Egyptian stamp on it.</p>

<p>I knew instinctively that this must contain
a declaration of war, yet Jakoub could not write
English. Nervously speculating, I had guessed
the authorship before I could bring myself to
open the envelope and read as follows:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>“<span class="smcap">Reverend Sir</span>,—</p>

<p>“I have been surprised that I have not yet<span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">[256]</span>
heard from you and am now bound to address
you as to my claims against you.</p>

<p>“In my hotel while you were here you took
possession of property belonging to myself and
others, and while under your charge against my
protests that property has disappeared. The cash
value of my share in that property is £750 and
my prospective profit in its sale was £1,250. This
sum of £2,000 in all I now demand from you with
£500 for other expenses and loss to which I am
put and for my refraining to proceed against you
at law as I might well. I shall look for your money
in one month. If not, my agent, whom you know
as Jakoub, will be in England and will call upon
you to arrange for my share as well as his own.
This will add expense and he informs me he will
accept £500 his share, without charge for his services
rendered to you. Your cheque for £3,000
will oblige and you will then receive discharge
in full from both of us.</p>

<p>“Failing this, I must take action as above
and my lawyer will advise as to proceeding in
Egyptian or English Court.</p>

<p class="right"><span class="indentright">“Your obedient Servant,</span><br>
“<span class="smcap">E. Van Ermengen</span>.”</p>
</div>

<p>I felt as if thrust back again into a world of
mean anxieties and sordid men. My mood of
content was shattered as a mirror by a stone,
and all the pleasantness of my surroundings was
gone as if it had been no more than the reflection
in the mirror.</p>

<p>If three thousand pounds would end the matter,
how gladly would I have made that sacrifice!
But I knew that money would not end it. What
had been done must still be expiated in other<span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">[257]</span>
coin. I must still oppose courage to baseness.
For me there could as yet be no settling back
into my comfortable groove, for courage was not
habitual to me; it had to be secreted, as it were,
by a constant effort of will.</p>

<p>I was wondering if that were true of all courage
when the bishop came in.</p>

<p>“I am afraid you have had bad news,” he said,
looking at me with concern as he took his place
at the breakfast table; “nothing wrong with your
brother, I hope?”</p>

<p>“I had not meant to tell you until after breakfast,”
I answered, sighing; “no, Edmund is all
right still, as far as I know.”</p>

<p>“Tell me the worst, then. No news should
spoil a man’s appetite when he has had a morning
swim. In fact that is the time of all others to
face anything that threatens.”</p>

<p>I read Van Ermengen’s letter to him. When
I had finished he read and re-read it to himself
as he finished a hearty breakfast.</p>

<p>“I do not regard this as bad news at all,” he
said at last, “but may I have a final cup of coffee
outside? It is too lovely a morning to waste
indoors.”</p>

<p>We went out through the French window to
a seat by the lime tree, which was already humming
like an æolian harp with the wings of insects.</p>

<p>Bates followed with the coffee and cigars, but
the bishop would not smoke.</p>

<p>“One can smoke all the year,” he said, “but
an atmosphere of wallflowers can only be enjoyed
on such a day as this.”</p>

<p>I thought of the strange contrast between my
Sussex garden with its peace and tempered sunshine,
and the fierce glare with which the same<span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">[258]</span>
sun was even now smiting the streets of Alexandria.
It seemed scarcely credible that a threat from
evil men out there could penetrate even into my
secluded vicarage. But there was the letter, and
as I watched the bishop studying it again it occurred
to me that the fighting spirit in him was glad
at the prospect of taking part in a struggle against
the manœuvres of the wicked.</p>

<p>“No,” he said, laying down the letter on the
seat between us, “on the whole it is good news.
You must have known that some such attempt
was inevitable. The man believes, of course, that
you have somehow disposed of the drug for your
own profit. To him that would doubtless seem
a perfectly natural move on your part. He simply
looks upon you as a hypocrite by whom he has
been outwitted. Of course such a man will not
easily be reconciled to the loss of his share of the
plunder. It should be a relief to you to know
how he means to open his game.”</p>

<p>“I suppose it should,” I admitted, “but the
prospect of seeing Jakoub here is not agreeable.”</p>

<p>“Of course it is disagreeable. But on the
other hand, it is a great gain that Jakoub is at
liberty. No doubt they are sending him here
because they feel he is no longer safe in Egypt.
Van Ermengen and his colleagues are as much
interested in his remaining free as we are. No
doubt Jakoub can convict them all and destroy
the conspiracy should he be taken himself. By
the way, do they suspect your relationship to
your brother?”</p>

<p>“I don’t think so. They have no reason to
suppose we are more than partners, for they have
never heard his real name.”</p>

<p>“Then if we can once convince them that the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">[259]</span>
hashish has been destroyed they will realise they
have no real weapon against you.”</p>

<p>“I wish,” I said weakly, “that I could pay
them off and be done with it.”</p>

<p>“That would be absolutely fatal, and in my
view immoral,” said the bishop sternly. “Besides,
you never would be done with it then.”</p>

<p>“Should I reply to this letter?” I asked.</p>

<p>“I think not. At present I think not. But
it requires consideration. It is better that Jakoub
should come here. We must keep him under
observation and safe from arrest. I hope your
brother and Welfare will return first, for they
will know better than we can how to handle the
ruffian. It might even be well, if they go to
Nyasaland, that they should take him with them.
They could offer him safety at least, and he might
look upon it as a new field for villainy.”</p>

<p>“He would certainly make it that,” I said.</p>

<p>“Yes. But no doubt Satan will see that he
is employed wherever he may be. I have little
hope of our power to save such as he is. There
is my car,” he continued as the sound of a motor-horn
came to us from the road; “my chaplain
is there to see I keep to his time-table. Well,
I am sorry my little time here is up. Keep me
fully informed of anything that may happen,
and don’t worry if I cannot answer your letters.”</p>

<p>We went back sadly through the house, and
as he was stepping into the car he paused and
said: “Do not write to Van Ermengen. It would
be a mistake. You can only wait now for things
to happen. Believe me, I know how difficult that is.”</p>

<p>With a heavy heart I watched his car drive
off, for I knew that anxiety and perplexity would
return to dwell with me in his absence.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XV<br>

<small>AWAITING DEVELOPMENTS</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">THE period of waiting for news of Edmund,
of what was really the opening of a
campaign against Jakoub, and the persons
whom he so largely controlled, was necessarily
for me a very irksome time.</p>

<p>I tried to thrust all these affairs into the background
of my thoughts and to wait on events in
a spirit of philosophic curiosity. In this laudable
attempt I was much helped by my necessary
preoccupation with parochial affairs.</p>

<p>I had left a peaceful community of Christian
souls, most of them doing their duty in life more
or less successfully, a few of them refusing or shirking
their responsibilities, and some behaving really badly.</p>

<p>I returned to find a population of whom practically
all were members of committees, all competing
for chairmanships and secretaryships, and nearly
all imbued with an acrid jealousy of each other.
Bee-hives and even gardens were being neglected
in this new enthusiasm for the redemption of
everybody by the formation of committees, and
envy, hatred, malice and all uncharitableness
stalked the parish in the wake of poor Snape,
just as though he had been some emissary of that
Potentate of the Manicheans to whose destruction
he had devoted his harmless, ineffectual life. Even<span class="pagenum" id="Page_261">[261]</span>
in the public-house I found that the old academic
discussions about prices in the local markets, and
their influence on Imperial stability, had given
place to acrimonious wrangles as to the personality
and conduct of competitors for prominence in
the new hierarchy of committees.</p>

<p>The publican said to me, “I’m selling less beer
and more whisky, sir. I’m making a bit extra,
but I don’t like it. They’d be better on beer
and the old-fashioned doctrines, and we’d all be
more comfortable. Whisky makes them quarrelsome,
and the new teetotallers as comes in for
ginger is mostly <i>rancorous</i>, sir. They says things
as I won’t have said to me or my missus in my
bar. And your reverence knows how my house
has been conducted ever since you was here.”</p>

<p>I departed, leaving my verbal certificate as
to his conduct, and pondering over his word
“rancorous.” It was the just word. It described
exactly the new spirit that I had to combat in
my parish. It appeared to me that christianity
had had a definite set-back in the village.</p>

<p>With a confidence newly born in me as the
result of my recent victories over Jakoub and
Van Ermengen, I asserted myself for the first
time as vicar of the parish.</p>

<p>As though they had been wasps’ nests, I stamped
out every committee that had been inaugurated
by Snape, and so restored to my parishioners
their natural good feeling and loving-kindness.</p>

<p>These preoccupations helped to divert my mind
from the more pressing anxieties of life while I
waited for news of Edmund, and it was not until
I had been home a month that I received a wire
from London telling me to expect him on the
same afternoon.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">[262]</span>My first impulse when he arrived was to tell
him of the bishop’s offer and of his new prospects,
but I felt I ought perhaps to leave that to the bishop
himself.</p>

<p>In any case the announcement would perforce
have been postponed, for Edmund arrived full
of anxieties. He had an alert and vigorous air
which I was glad to see, but it was clear that he
was harassed and anxious. He cut my greetings
rather short and asked me to come straight into
the study.</p>

<p>“I must tell you the worst of it at once,” he
said, as he closed the door; “Van Ermengen and
Jakoub are on the move already.”</p>

<p>“I know that,” I told him; “I have had a
letter from Van Ermengen.”</p>

<p>“You have? Confound his cheek! What does
he say?”</p>

<p>I took Van Ermengen’s letter from my desk
and handed it to him. He read it carefully, standing
on the hearthrug with one arm resting on the
mantelpiece.</p>

<p>Watching him from my desk chair I noticed
his face flush and the frown deepen on his forehead.
He looked older than I had ever seen
him look before, and it struck me that Edmund
might be a very dangerous man to an enemy.</p>

<p>“Yes,” he said as he replaced the letter in the
envelope; “of course you have sent him no money?”</p>

<p>“Of course not. I have not answered the
letter at all.”</p>

<p>“Good. Well, it is not an idle threat about
Jakoub. Jakoub is on board a tramp which is
due in Southampton to-morrow. If he is not
arrested he will make straight for here. Welfare
has gone to Southampton to see what happens<span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">[263]</span>
and to keep an eye on him. If necessary, he will
follow him here. Then we shall have to decide
on the best means of keeping him quiet.”</p>

<p>“I do hope he won’t be arrested,” I said; “why
do you think he may be? Tell me how you know
all this.”</p>

<p>“Welfare heard it all from Van Ermengen.
But I had better tell you the story right through.
Have you got any of those cigars left?”</p>

<p>I produced the cigar box, and as Edmund settled
himself to smoke comfortably in an arm-chair,
I could see that he was tired and short of sleep.</p>

<p>“Welfare and I only met in London yesterday,”
he said. “We met by appointment, after parting
at Marseilles. We thought we could cover up
our tracks better by taking different ways. I
think you may take it that Montgomery and Ringrose
have finally disappeared from the knowledge
of mankind. We have evaporated, volatilised in
fact. I ought first to tell you that we had to
sell the poor little <i>Astarte</i> all standing for about
a third of her value. It was a nasty jar parting
with her to a Dago Jew anyhow, but of course
it was a forced sale. There was no time to bargain.
Apart from the loss, we both felt that our accepting
such a price looked fishy. But that could not
be helped, and in any case, as Montgomery and
Ringrose, our number was up! We had to get
rid of her quickly and clear out.”</p>

<p>“Of course,” I said as he paused in his narrative,
“you know how sorry I am to have parted with the
<i>Astarte</i>. The price cannot be helped. The loss does
not matter as long as you do get clear in the end.”</p>

<p>“Well, I hope to,” Edmund replied dubiously,
eyeing his cigar. “It all depends on Jakoub.
As long as he is free we can manage him. Once<span class="pagenum" id="Page_264">[264]</span>
arrested he would of course try to drag us all in.
He would do that out of spite, anyhow; besides,
it would be his last card, his only hope of pardon.
And we are not sure how much he knows about
us. But he knows you in your proper name.”</p>

<p>I felt the perspiration break out all over my
body as I thus saw clearly for the first time all
the possible consequences of Jakoub’s arrest, of
his turning informer. I knew for the first time
what it meant to have one’s “heart sink,” for
it seemed as though my heart actually became
a weight in my body of which I was conscious,
and a horrible sensation of weakness spread downwards
to my thighs. For a few moments I am
sure I could not have risen from my chair as I
realised that everything that social man holds
dear was, in my case, in the keeping of a rascally
Arab whom the Law was seeking to attack. And
the Law was on the side for which I had sacrificed
so much! I was as anxious as the Law to stop
the atrocious conspiracy that was poisoning a
race. And I had actually achieved my object—illegally.
The bishop’s phrase recurred to me.
“Surely,” I thought, “here was a case where
the Law became an organised stupidity.”</p>

<p>“I hate upsetting you like this,” Edmund
continued, “but you simply must be told.”</p>

<p>“Of course,” I said; “go on.”</p>

<p>“Fortunately,” he continued, “you have done
nothing wrong. You will have no difficulty in
clearing yourself. But obviously Welfare and I
would become your essential witnesses, and nothing
you could say, nothing in heaven or earth, would
stop us giving evidence on your behalf. But
I know, I understand. Everything you have
worked so hard for, would be, well—simply done<span class="pagenum" id="Page_265">[265]</span>
in! You wanted to save me, to save the family
name. You cannot save me if Jakoub is a prisoner,
but surely you see, every straight man
must see, that my disgrace, as far as the family
honour goes, would be far more than balanced
by your—your infernal decency.”</p>

<p>I found myself out of my chair and tottering
foolishly about the room.</p>

<p>“It can’t happen! It must not happen!”
I exclaimed.</p>

<p>“It may not happen,” Edmund said, “but
you and I must be ready for it if it does happen.”</p>

<p>“Tell me,” I said, calming myself with an
effort, “tell me just what the risks are. How
did Welfare hear? What did Van Ermengen say?”</p>

<p>“Welfare picked up his letters in London
yesterday, and among them were two from Van
Ermengen. You probably don’t realise that Van
Ermengen is convinced that you have collared
the whole cargo in order to sell it yourself. What
puzzles him is that there should have been anyone
in the trade unknown to himself; especially anyone
capable of controlling Welfare. He is not sure
now where Welfare stands in the matter, and
his first letter simply appeals to him to remain
‘loyal’ and assist in squeezing you. The second
letter was to say that he had smuggled Jakoub
on to this tramp as a stoker, partly to get him
out of Egypt where he is no longer safe, and partly
to help in blackmailing you. His fear is that
the police may trace Jakoub to the ship and get
him arrested at this end. You see Van Ermengen
is naturally as anxious as we are to keep Jakoub
out of the grip of the law. Van Ermengen is
more hopelessly compromised than any of us,
and he knows Jakoub.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_266">[266]</span>Edmund’s apparent imperturbability, his calm
exposition of the situation, did a great deal to
restore my nervous equilibrium. I sat down
opposite to him, and for a time there was silence
as we both thought out the probabilities. Edmund’s
meditations had evidently reached the same point
as mine when he broke the silence.</p>

<p>“It is about five to one,” he remarked, “that
the police here will have been warned and will
try to arrest him.”</p>

<p>“Do you think there is any chance of their
failing?” I asked.</p>

<p>“Lots of chances. Jakoub has been warned
himself, and he is not an easy man to catch. He
has spent most of his life dodging the police or
somebody else. He will probably get away from
them at Southampton, but there, in a strange
country, he will be handicapped. Welfare may
be able to help him. If he makes his way here
we shall have to hide him—that is, if you are
willing to.”</p>

<p>This proposition startled me. It seemed somehow
quite a different thing for me at home, as
vicar of the parish and a county magistrate, to
join in evading English law and English policemen,
and for that other self of mine who had wandered
across the high seas in a little sailing boat, and
across the desert on the back of a camel, to take
part in outwitting Egyptian laws and Egyptian
police.</p>

<p>Edmund noticed my hesitation and took me
up in the old quick way of his boyish sensitiveness.</p>

<p>“Of course I know it would be a horrible risk
for you in your position. Personally I advise
you to have nothing to do with the business.”</p>

<p>He spoke in the hurt tone I remembered so<span class="pagenum" id="Page_267">[267]</span>
well in old days when I had refused to countenance
some wild cat scheme of his.</p>

<p>“I am not calculating the risk,” I said; “I
see and understand it clearly, and for myself I
do not fear the consequences. To get us all out
of this wretched tangle I am willing to do anything
that is just and honourable. Would this be just
and honourable? For myself I think it would;
but then am I a competent judge of my own actions
in a thing like this! I don’t know. I don’t
know!”</p>

<p>I was thinking aloud, forgetful of Edmund.</p>

<p>“My dear old man!” he cried, getting up
and taking my hands, “you are straining your
conscience until you’ll dislocate the poor old thing,
just for my sake. Don’t do it. I cannot stand
it! Welfare and I can evaporate again. The
world is round and one can go round it. Hand
over Jakoub and let him get what he deserves.
I shall be glad of it, and I will let you do anything
else you like for my sake. And we shall find ways
of seeing each other again. But don’t do this.
I hate myself for suggesting it. I simply had
not thought.”</p>

<p>“Thanks, dear lad,” I said, returning the pressure
of his hands, “but don’t let us exaggerate things.
I repeat that I think your proposal is the right
one, right from every point of view. Even Jakoub
was a straight man once, until he was defrauded
by stupid official people. Why should he not
have a chance to become straight again? I was
thinking he might be worked into the bishop’s
scheme for you and Welfare. By the way, you
have heard nothing about that. But I do feel
that we both need guidance. I have sent word
to the bishop that you are here. I promised him<span class="pagenum" id="Page_268">[268]</span>
to do that, and I know he will join us as soon as
he can.”</p>

<p>“The bishop coming here?” Edmund asked,
shying from the idea like a nervous horse. “But
must he be told all this?”</p>

<p>“He has been told everything. That is, everything
I knew up to now.”</p>

<p>“And he would still meet me?”</p>

<p>“He is most anxious to meet you, and Welfare
too for that matter. He has a project that he
will tell you of himself. He knows that Jakoub
is our one danger.”</p>

<p>“But surely,” Edmund exclaimed, “he would
not approve of our sheltering Jakoub?”</p>

<p>“If he does not approve, I cannot consent
to do it. I don’t know, but I think he would
approve. I am sure he would if he had any
reason to think that so we might save Jakoub.
‘Save’ him I mean in the only true sense, which
is to make a true man of him again.”</p>

<p>“Nothing would make a true man of Jakoub,”
said Edmund.</p>

<p>“To refuse to believe that is the real meaning
of what we call Faith,” I answered.</p>

<p>There was another long pause between us, and
then Edmund said very thoughtfully, “I cannot
understand this bishop of yours.”</p>

<p>“It is not to be expected that you should,”
I assured him. “I doubt if anyone understands
him. Probably I understand more of him than
anyone else, and I know only a little of him. But
I know this, that he sees men as they are, not
as ‘trees walking.’ He is not half-blinded like
so many of us parsons. He knows the residuum
of decency there is in all human nature, and how
it is buried under the silt of mere majorities. But<span class="pagenum" id="Page_269">[269]</span>
never mind all that. I hope he will be here to-morrow,
and he will tell us what to do.”</p>

<p>“I am in your hands, of course, and therefore
it seems in the bishop’s. I shall certainly do
what you and he think right, only first I must
tell him everything myself.”</p>

<p>“That is exactly what I want you to do.”</p>

<p>I had greatly dreaded the possibility of Edmund’s
refusing to meet the bishop at all. I knew how
intensely his pride must be wounded by the prospect
of such a meeting, of such a confession. But
I knew, too, how necessary it was for the healing
of his soul. I regarded it as his penance, and
for him the way of salvation. I was accordingly
careful to conceal my knowledge of his feelings
and to treat the bishop’s visit as a matter of course.</p>

<p>“With all your news,” I said, “I have had
no time to tell you that the bishop is coming
mainly to offer you an appointment abroad under
the Colonial Office. He will tell you the details,
but I think it is one you would like.”</p>

<p>“Like it!” he exclaimed, “I am sure I should
‘like it.’ I should like it better than going to
prison as the accomplice of a set of particularly
unclean Dagoes. But don’t you see I am much
more in the hands of Jakoub than of the bishop?
I can decide nothing until Jakoub is muzzled
or—dead. And if Jakoub is taken—well, the
matter is settled as far as I am concerned.”</p>

<p>I saw it very clearly, and there was nothing
to reply.</p>

<p>We spent the evening under a cloud of anxiety
trying to calculate the chances of Jakoub’s evading
the police at Southampton and the probable time
of his arrival at the vicarage if he succeeded.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XVI<br>

<small>IN WHICH CAPTAIN WELFARE MAKES A SIGNAL</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">BOTH Edmund’s temper and my own were
naturally worn a little thin under the
tension of this uncertainty, and the friction
of our futile calculations of chances. But neither
of us could leave the subject alone or settle our
minds to anything else. Each of us made guesses
which to the other seemed more and more foolish
and irritating. Edmund set himself to prove the
inevitability of disaster, really, I suppose, in order
to elicit my arguments in favour of optimism,
which nevertheless he took a morbid pleasure in
demolishing.</p>

<p>The bishop’s arrival on the following afternoon
was only just in time to dispel something like a
positive mutual dislike which was being engendered
between us by the strain.</p>

<p>But, as I knew he would, the bishop brought
with him an atmosphere of sanity and hopefulness.
He did not attempt to minimise the gravity of our
position when it was explained to him, but helped
us to look the hard facts in the face.</p>

<p>“If the man has been arrested,” he said, “it
seems to me that we are powerless. The whole of
the facts are bound to come out. Your conduct,”
he added, turning to me, “has of course been
blameless, even, I should imagine, from the legal<span class="pagenum" id="Page_271">[271]</span>
point of view. At least I do not quite see in what
form any charge could be made against you. The
extreme difficulty of the circumstances in which
you were placed would of course be appreciated.
I do not see how your action could be described as
abetting, since you did all in your power to break
up the conspiracy and defeat its ends.</p>

<p>“Your brother’s case is of course quite different.
The fact that he had no direct financial interest
in the sale of the drug is only an extenuating
circumstance. You were aware of the whole transaction,”
he said, addressing Edmund; “you aided
in it, if only by helping to navigate the boat. I
do not think there is the least doubt that a judge
would take a very grave view of your offence,
and of its effect on the prestige of the English in
Egypt. In your case discovery would of course
mean irretrievable disgrace, a punishment utterly
out of all proportion to the real sinfulness of your
act, at least as I see it. It is because of the injustice
involved in that, in what would be the real sentence,
and because of the damage that would be done to
our countrymen in the East, that I feel we are
justified in circumventing the law, if that be still
possible.”</p>

<p>I could see the tide of humiliation pass across
Edmund’s face, as he sat with folded arms, listening
to the bishop’s calm judicial statement of the position,
but when at last he looked up, I thought I
saw in his eyes that it had been a cleansing tide.</p>

<p>“I am afraid,” he said very slowly, “it would
be impertinent in me, my lord, to thank you for
what you are doing, for what you have proposed
to do, even for speaking to me, after you have
known all this about me. God knows I understand
now the rottenness of my whole life so far.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_272">[272]</span>
If I could only keep my brother’s name out of it,
I would rather that everything came out; I would
rather take the punishment. I do not mind, since
you and he think I might have made good still, if
the chance had come. I can face everything but
disgrace coming home to him. You know he has
been more than any brother to me. I had forgotten
what it was to be a gentleman. But if I
have to make my new start in prison I shall act as
one now. I can do it, since you believe I could.
I wish I knew how to thank you.”</p>

<p>Edmund’s voice broke in a sob very painful to
us to hear.</p>

<p>The bishop rose and went over to him. “My
dear boy,” he said, laying a hand on his shoulder
with an instinctive pastoral gesture, “you are
welcome to thank me. I know it is a natural,
wholesome desire. But you must understand that
I am only trying to interpret what I believe to be
our Lord’s attitude to sinners who repent. You
have probably come to disbelieve in what is called
prayer. Nevertheless prayer is a natural instinct
implanted in all of us; a desire we cannot get
rid of, whatever our beliefs or disbeliefs may be.
I advise you to leave us now and go and yield to
that instinct. Whatever may happen now we
need say no more about this aspect of the case.”</p>

<p>As Edmund rose to obey him, the bishop took
his hand for a moment in silence, and there was a
look in his face that made me think of Him who
rose “with healing in his wings.”</p>

<p>“Poor warped boy!” he exclaimed as the door
closed; “there is a great capacity for goodness
and nobility in him, all stunted by mere circumstance.
Davoren, I feel that we must save him at
almost any cost. Why should we desire the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_273">[273]</span>
punishment even of this nefarious Arab? It will
surely be better to make him ‘cease to do evil and
learn to do well.’ Have you ever thought out
the distinction between crime and sin?”</p>

<p>“I have never regarded them as necessarily
related,” I answered.</p>

<p>“No, they are not. If we could establish that
essential relationship we should have achieved
the ideal State. Probably that was what Plato
really meant. But now we must come down to
sordid details. Assuming that this Arab escapes
the police and finds you here, have you any plan
for dealing with him?”</p>

<p>“None. We have discussed it up and down
since yesterday, but could come to no conclusion.”</p>

<p>“I should be inclined to offer him a chance to
accompany your brother and Captain Welfare,
that is if they decided to go to Nyasaland. We
could offer him congenial employment, fair pay,
and above all a chance of escape from ‘justice.’
We must remember that the one strength of our
position is that he is a hunted man. A desperate
man is dangerous, therefore the proper treatment
for him is to offer him hope.”</p>

<p>We spent a long time discussing what our course
should be if the worst came to pass, and how we
were to make a future for Edmund when he should
have purged his folly. The afternoon was fading
into evening, when Bates came in with a perturbed
expression.</p>

<p>“I beg your pardon, sir,” he said, “there is a man
at the door who refuses to go away until he has seen
you.”</p>

<p>“Well, Bates? Why should he not see me?
What is his business?”</p>

<p>“He wouldn’t say, sir. Excuse me, sir, but he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_274">[274]</span>
is a foreign looking person, though not dressed
as such. I think he is one of those Arabs that
came in the yacht, sir.”</p>

<p>The bishop and I looked at each other with a
great relief. Here was Jakoub, and he was still
at liberty, the worst had not yet come to pass.</p>

<p>“I’ll go and see him, Bates,” I said; “will you
excuse me, bishop?”</p>

<p>“Don’t mind me if you wish to bring him in here,”
the bishop answered in a perfectly natural manner.</p>

<p>I went out to meet Jakoub at the door, Bates
following me like a dog bristling with distrust of
some instinctive foe.</p>

<p>As soon as he opened the door a man stepped
quickly inside, in spite of a protesting movement
from Bates.</p>

<p>For a moment my heart misgave me, for in this
cloth-capped stranger, clad in cheap but respectable
brown tweed, I failed to recognise Jakoub. But
a flash from his eyes reassured me, and there was
no mistaking his greeting. “All raight, effendi!”
he said in his old mocking tone, “it is I, Jakoub.”</p>

<p>I think his quick intuition was disconcerted at
my manifest pleasure in welcoming him! No
doubt he had calculated on meeting fear or anger.</p>

<p>“Come in,” I said cordially. “I am very glad
to see you again, Jakoub. It is quite right, Bates,
just go and tell Mr. Edmund he will find an old
friend with us in the study.”</p>

<p>Bates went upstairs distrustfully, and I led
Jakoub into the study.</p>

<p>“Bishop, this is Jakoub,” I said with a happy
smile; “Jakoub, this is my sheikh.”</p>

<p>The bishop nodded pleasantly and Jakoub instinctively
salaamed, touching his forehead and
breast.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_275">[275]</span>He stood with his hands folded before him looking
uneasily from one to the other of us. He was
evidently nonplussed and suspicious, and doubtless
felt at a disadvantage in the strange ugly clothes
which vulgarised and robbed him of all his natural
dignity.</p>

<p>“I came to speak with you private,” he said
sullenly.</p>

<p>“Sit down then. We are private. The sheikh
knows all about our business, Jakoub. Mr. Montgomery
is here too. He will be with us in a
moment.”</p>

<p>I used the false name purposely to try if Jakoub
knew Edmund by any other, but he made no
comment.</p>

<p>“If you think I am in a trap, you mistake. Very
big mistake,” he muttered viciously.</p>

<p>“None of us thinks so, Jakoub. If you are in
trouble, we want to help you. Have a cigarette?”
He took the cigarette greedily, as one who had
fasted for some time. It seemed to restore a little
of his confidence.</p>

<p>“Jakoub is in no trouble,” he remarked, as he
sat uneasily on the edge of a low chair.</p>

<p>Edmund came in at this moment, quite calm
and collected, without a trace of his recent emotional
crisis.</p>

<p>“Well, Jakoub,” he said, “you have turned up?”</p>

<p>“Yes. I have come. I have come for my
rights, for my money and for Van Ermengen,
effendi’s. We will not be robbed.”</p>

<p>“No,” said Edmund, “but you may be arrested,
you know. The police——”</p>

<p>“Bah! Your police—I fear them not. We
knew they would wait for me at your harbour.
So I make myself to have the job to go away in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_276">[276]</span>
little boat with a line to the buoy. Last night
before the steamer stop, before the gangway is
out, I am away from her in the dark. I wrap my
galabieh round a stone and drop her in the water.
Then I put on these, these clothes, boots, hat;
and I row to a good place on the shore, while your
police are looking for me on the ship! Who will
find Jakoub now? I am not a mouse to walk in
a trap!”</p>

<p>“That was very clever,” the bishop put in.</p>

<p>“It is my business to be clever!” said Jakoub,
showing his teeth a little, as he looked round from
one to the other of us, malignant and implacable.</p>

<p>I was at a loss as to how to continue the conversation.
I felt as I have sometimes felt when trying
to play chess for the entertainment of better players,
uncertain even as to whose move it was next. It
was therefore a great relief to me when Edmund
spoke in a tone that suggested his intention of taking
command of our side.</p>

<p>“You had better tell us,” he said, “why you
have come here, and what it is that you want.”</p>

<p>“I have come for the money I am owed, I and
Van Ermengen effendi. I have my papers, my
account.”</p>

<p>He sought in the unfamiliar pockets of what
tailors call a “lounge suit,” and produced a folded
sheet of foolscap which Edmund took from him.</p>

<p>“We have already had all this by post from
Van Ermengen,” Edmund remarked as he looked over
the paper. “Why did he send you here?”</p>

<p>“Because you did not answer. You sent no
money,” Jakoub answered doggedly.</p>

<p>“And suppose we send this money to Van
Ermengen, how are you going to get your share
from him? If we enable you to escape the police<span class="pagenum" id="Page_277">[277]</span>
here, will you go back to Egypt? Don’t take
me for a fool, Jakoub. It won’t help you.”</p>

<p>“You pay me my share here. I care no more
for Van Ermengen.”</p>

<p>The bishop and I looked at each other. We began
to see the drift of Edmund’s diplomacy; to detach
Jakoub from Van Ermengen was decidedly a gain.</p>

<p>“I don’t suppose you do care for him,” Edmund
said, “and yet you are trying to play his game,
knowing he will swindle you in the end.”</p>

<p>“But without him I could not have come here,”
Jakoub pointed out with another smile of cool
effrontery.</p>

<p>“I could stay no more in Egypt,” he added,
“so I use Van Ermengen to find you and Captain
Ringrose, and the effendi here. It is you who have
gone with my property—you are the thieves, and
you will give back my share, or come with me to
the prison.”</p>

<p>“You might get us into prison, Jakoub, but you
could not get us hanged. Do you know,” he asked
suddenly, taking a step towards Jakoub and standing
over him in a threatening attitude, “do you know
that we can have you hanged? Do you know
that we found Achmed in Marseilles and he told
us all that happened in that house at Damanhour
where the merchant was murdered two years ago?
We know where to find Achmed whenever we want
him.”</p>

<p>Jakoub’s face was distorted with the spasm of
sudden terror, like that of a man who suddenly
sees some unsuspected object close by him in the
dark. His right hand made a movement towards
the unaccustomed breast pocket, but Edmund
seized his wrist in a flash. His grasp brought a
cry from Jakoub.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_278">[278]</span>“Effendi! You break my arm! Let me go.”</p>

<p>“Hand over your weapon first.”</p>

<p>“I have none. I swear it. Search me, effendi!”</p>

<p>Edmund slowly relinquished his grasp. I thought
of the knife I had seen in Jakoub’s hand that
night at Alexandria when I was awakened by
the brushing of that hand along my bedroom wall.
But I was paralysed by the sudden violence of this
scene in my quiet study. I saw the bishop sitting
tense, braced for sudden action. But Edmund
did not trouble to search Jakoub; he lounged back
to the mantelpiece and it seemed that a crisis
had ended.</p>

<p>“It does not matter if you have a weapon,
Jakoub, for you dare not use it. Now listen, we
offer you safety, or at least to help you to safety
if we can. You may not believe it, but it is a
fact that the whole of the hashish is at the bottom
of the sea. We threw it overboard and sank it
for reasons of our own. We may help you to earn
an honest living in safety, if you choose to. At
least, that is what we meant to offer you. But
these gentlemen did not know for certain until
this minute that you were a murderer. When I
tell them what the man was whom you killed,
they may still help you. I do not know.”</p>

<p>Edmund paused and looked enquiringly at the
bishop.</p>

<p>“We ought to have known of this,” the bishop
said very gravely.</p>

<p>“I was going to tell you, my lord. If I may
send Jakoub out of the room I will tell you the whole
story. He had better think over our offer, in
case it still holds good. But understand, Jakoub,
that alone and unaided in England you can no
more escape our police than a quail can escape<span class="pagenum" id="Page_279">[279]</span>
your net when it lands in Egypt. This is not
Egypt. If you choose to quarrel with us you know
now what to expect.”</p>

<p>I felt a kind of pity for Jakoub as I looked at
him. He was changed from the masterful villain
I had known, the man to whose skill and courage
in the desert I probably owed my life.</p>

<p>He was now a huddled figure in his chair, and
under Edmund’s new threat he looked beaten, weak,
and forlorn. It occurred to me that he might
have had little or no food on his journey, and I
always find something pathetic in the more primitive
human needs. I was sure, too, that Jakoub would
regard Edmund’s last remark as a warning that the
whole system of backshish would, in this country,
be against him as a foreigner without money.
It would seem to him quite natural that a person
like myself should have the entire legislature in
his pay, and this would of course be a depressing
thought. My feelings as a host were aroused
on his behalf, but I recognised the impossibility
of suggesting that he should join us at dinner.</p>

<p>“Perhaps,” I said, “Jakoub is ready for some
food and a glass of wine? I am sorry not to have
thought of it sooner. I am afraid you are tired,
Jakoub.”</p>

<p>I noticed a flicker of humorous appreciation of
the situation pass between Edmund and Jakoub,
and as the latter must have had murder in his heart
but a moment before, and the other had used
force to frustrate the intention, I suppose my
conventional words were really somewhat absurd.</p>

<p>But Jakoub rose and salaamed with the ceremony
demanded of an Oriental when hospitality
is in question.</p>

<p>“Jakoub is never tired,” he said, “but he has<span class="pagenum" id="Page_280">[280]</span>
come far, fasting. The effendi is kind, and Jakoub
gives thanks to Allah and to him. Jakoub needs
food and remembers the red wine he drank in the
Temple of Osiris. It is not yet Ramadan.”</p>

<p>“That’s all right,” I said, “I’ll ring for Bates.”</p>

<p>Bates at the door, in response to my summons,
gave us a wonderful piece of acting. He was
representing the part of a servant unconscious
of the existence of the foreign element in our conclave.
The perfect correctness of his demeanour
made all three of us feel abject in a way that no
threat from Jakoub could have done.</p>

<p>“Bates,” I said, “this gentleman will have some
dinner in the morning-room. And tell Mrs. Rattray
that we shall be ready in a quarter of an hour.”</p>

<p>Bates’s aspect relaxed its severity at once, and I
perceived that I had acquired merit in his eyes.
He knew that I never referred to my friends as
“gentlemen,” and my use of the term now was,
in his eyes, opprobrious. I think he may have
suspected me of an intention to have Jakoub in
the dining-room, which would have involved his
giving me notice, and wrecking his own life’s happiness.
As it was, he made an imperious gesture
to Jakoub, who followed him out of the room quite
meekly.</p>

<p>“I think we had better go and dress,” I said,
looking at my watch, “we can talk things over after
dinner.”</p>

<p>We said no more to each other then, but as we
went upstairs in silence it occurred to me that
Bates might handle Jakoub more successfully even
than the bishop.</p>

<p>Dinner that night was a meal purposely abbreviated,
for we could not resume our discussion until
Bates had completed his functions and left us with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_281">[281]</span>
the walnuts and a decanter of port for Edmund and
myself.</p>

<p>The lingering twilight of summer reduced the
shaded candles on the table to the level of an agreeable
but adventitious ornament. There are few
things more lovely than the ruby patch on white
damask of candle-light focussed through cut glass
containing some ancient vintage of the grape of
sun-soaked Portugal. That crimson spot, with
radiating lines and concentric curves of topaz light,
has always given me, since childhood days, the thrill
of joy that jewellery provides, and stained-glass
windows, and distant rockets bursting inaudible
in a summer sky.</p>

<p>I think we all three were conscious of the hedonistic
influence of our surroundings, and found it
difficult to bring our minds back to the sinister
presence in the adjoining room, to the idea of Jakoub
there, calculating his line of conduct from an
ethical standpoint unintelligible to us.</p>

<p>I certainly felt an intense reluctance to return
to the consideration of our clouded future, and I
am sure the others shared it.</p>

<p>We might have sat there indefinitely as far as
I was concerned. But the bishop with a sigh recalled
us to the immediate necessities of our situation.</p>

<p>We had been discoursing pleasantly of many
things interesting but remote from our immediate
circumstances, when he broke in on our artificial
calm.</p>

<p>“Well, we are keeping Jakoub waiting,” he said;
“had we not better know the facts about this new
charge against him?”</p>

<p>“Yes. You must know the facts. I have been
waiting to tell you,” Edmund answered. “I can only
give you the facts as I have heard them from a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_282">[282]</span>
man who has no reason to love Jakoub. All I
can say is that both Welfare and I have every
reason to believe the story, for we both knew the
man who was killed. Either of us would have
killed him if we could. It is a disgusting story.”</p>

<p>It was a story so loathsome in its details that
I have tried to blot them from my mind. It concerned
an elderly Egyptian who had made vast
sums of money by land speculations at the time
when the Egyptian cotton industry was embryonic.
He had chosen one of his sons as his heir, and sent
the youth to Europe to be “educated.” The young
man had absorbed all the villainy and corruption
that can be found in the lowest classes of the great
cities of England and the continent, and returned
to inherit his father’s wealth with his native Oriental
brutality instructed and refined by Western cunning
and Western niceties of debauchery and greed.
As he lost his inherited wealth to more cunning
rogues, he tried to recover it by becoming the
principal organiser of the hashish trade. In this
capacity he came to owe Jakoub the wages of
subordinate villainy. Jakoub had taken him by
surprise in his secret villa at Damanhour. He had
found him torturing a woman who had been a girl
in Jakoub’s village in the Delta. Jakoub had slain
him and escaped undetected. Edmund had now
found a witness who could prove Jakoub to be
the murderer.</p>

<p>“I have threatened Jakoub with this knowledge,”
Edmund concluded, “but sooner than use
it against him really, I would have my tongue
torn out.”</p>

<p>Neither of us made any comment on the story,
and Edmund remained silent during a considerable
pause, nervously fidgeting with his napkin ring.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_283">[283]</span>“I think we must have the man in, Davoren,”
the bishop said at last, “but first we must be quite
assured as to what we are to say to him.”</p>

<p>“Yes. We had better get it over,” I agreed.</p>

<p>“Am I to understand definitely,” the bishop
asked Edmund, “that if all goes well you will accept
this offer of the Colonial Secretary?”</p>

<p>“I will indeed, most thankfully,” Edmund assured
him.</p>

<p>“And you think it probable that Captain Welfare
would join you?”</p>

<p>“I cannot imagine his refusing.”</p>

<p>“Well, that’s all right so far——”</p>

<p>He was interrupted by a metallic clang, twice
repeated. It was the old sound of the hammer
on the anvil in the forge, brought to us along the
tunnel. But it was an unusual time to hear it,
and to all of us there was something minatory in
the sound of those three strokes.</p>

<p>The bishop broke off in his sentence, and we all
three listened, silent and uneasy.</p>

<p>The three loud strokes were repeated.</p>

<p>“They are working late at the forge,” the bishop
remarked.</p>

<p>“That is not blacksmith’s work,” I answered
with an apprehensive note in my voice.</p>

<p>There came a succession of blows, apparently
from a lighter hammer, yet with a sound unusual
and unfamiliar to me, making as it were a kind
of tune.</p>

<p>Suddenly Edmund’s face “sprang to attention”
as it were. He took a pencil from his pocket, and
seizing a menu card, began making rapid marks on
it, as the tune on the anvil rang on.</p>

<p>The bishop and I watched him in amazement.</p>

<p>“It’s Welfare,” he said; “our private call in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_284">[284]</span>
Morse. Here’s his message coming. Excuse me.”</p>

<p>For some minutes the noise went on, the bishop
and I, elbows on table, watching Edmund as he
jotted down dots and dashes on the cardboard.
He put out his hand for a fresh card, and I had
had the sense to have one ready for him, so there
was no interruption in his recording of the message.</p>

<p>Presently the hammering ceased.</p>

<p>We listened for a moment, but no more sound
came from the anvil. Edmund set himself to
deciphering and transcribing the message.</p>

<p>Finally he read aloud: “Police traced Jakoub to
vicarage. Doors watched. Will arrest at once.
Send him down passage. I will meet him at end.”</p>

<p>“We must act at once,” the bishop observed,
rising from his chair; “perhaps you had better
get him away,” he added to Edmund. Edmund
nodded and moved towards the door.</p>

<p>“One moment,” I said, “I must get Mrs. Rattray
and the maid out of the kitchen. We shall have to
take Bates into our confidence.”</p>

<p>I left the room, and finding Mrs. Rattray sent her
and her assistant to carry out some extraordinary
rearrangement of the bishop’s room. I told her
that his Lordship had been unwell, and these
arrangements were the doctor’s orders. This
silenced her protests of amazement, and having
got rid of the women I spoke hurriedly to Bates
in the hall.</p>

<p>“Bates,” I said, “the police are coming here for
this Arab. They will be here any moment now.”</p>

<p>“Very good, sir.” Bates answered with evident
gratification.</p>

<p>“But he is not to be arrested here. Mr. Edmund
has particular reasons for not wishing it.”</p>

<p>“Oh, very well, sir.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_285">[285]</span>“Mr. Edmund is going to let him out through
the cellar, into the passage. When the police call
you will show them into the dining-room. In the
meantime you must make it appear that the man
has gone through the morning-room window. Do
you understand?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p>“I am afraid, Bates, it may not be possible for
you to speak the precise truth about the business—to
the police, I mean. Have you any objection?”</p>

<p>“Well, sir, as long as you and his Lordship say
so, I have no doubt it is all correct.”</p>

<p>“That’s all right then.”</p>

<p>As I spoke Edmund came out of the morning-room
with Jakoub.</p>

<p>“The idiot swears it’s a trap. He says he won’t
go unless the ‘sheikh,’ as he calls him, promises
we are doing the straight thing.”</p>

<p>“It is Ringrose,” growled Jakoub; “I know him;
this is his plan to trap me.”</p>

<p>“I swear, Jakoub——” I began, but then the
bishop, who had overheard the conversation, joined
us.</p>

<p>“I promise you,” he said, “in the name of the
one God whom we both worship, that we are doing
what we believe to be the best thing for you as
well as for others. I promise that in this we are
dealing faithfully with you. Now go quickly. It
is your only chance of safety.”</p>

<p>Jakoub followed Edmund down to the cellar without
another word.</p>

<p>The bishop and I returned to the dining-room
and resumed our seats at the table.</p>

<p>My heart was beating painfully as we heard
through the floor the harsh grating of the door
that led from the cellar to the passage. We heard<span class="pagenum" id="Page_286">[286]</span>
it opened, and it seemed an age before it was dragged
to, and the rusty bolts shot back. I think the
bishop breathed a little rapidly too.</p>

<p>As Edmund rejoined us with an enquiring glance
I shook my head.</p>

<p>“I wonder what is keeping them,” he said as
he sat down in his place.</p>

<p>I explained briefly what I had arranged with
Bates.</p>

<p>“Don’t you think, bishop,” I asked, “that it
would be better for you to leave us? If anything
were to go wrong, it would be intolerable that
your name should even be mentioned.”</p>

<p>“It is certainly disagreeable,” he replied; “it is
intensely painful to deceive these men in the
execution of their duty. We are unquestionably
aiding a criminal to escape, in fact ‘compounding
a felony.’ Nevertheless, my conscience is quite
definite in the matter and approves of what we are
doing. It is the old question, Davoren, of the
difference between crime and sin. The crime for
which the law would put this man to death was
not a sin. It was manifestly a righteous action.
It was an impulse which no decent man would
have resisted. Of course, society could not exist
if everyone were to be allowed to decide such questions.
But I claim as much right to judge of
wickedness as a judge has to decide questions of
crime. But if I left you now it would be cowardice,
and my conscience would not acquit me.”</p>

<p>“But how terribly the world would misjudge
you!”</p>

<p>“That is not a thing from which a Christian
should shrink,” the bishop observed quietly, and
so closed the discussion.</p>

<p>Edmund helped himself to a glass of wine.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_287">[287]</span>“It will look more natural when they come in,”
he said, “as if we were only just finishing dinner.”</p>

<p>I was glad to follow his example, for in truth
the sudden development of our perplexities, the
strange manner of its announcement, and the
necessity for sudden action had left me shaken in
mind and body and, I fear, a little tremulous.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XVII<br>

<small>HOW CAPTAIN WELFARE RETURNED</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">WE waited but a few moments in silence
before Bates ushered in our local constable,
an old friend of mine, and one
who had a professional veneration for my position
as a County Magistrate, who sat in judgment alike
on vagrants and poachers, and those haughty
contemners of the law who exceed the speed limit
in expensive motor-cars.</p>

<p>He was clearly very much embarrassed as he
introduced his companion, an officer in plain
clothes, whom he announced as Sergeant Moore, of
Southampton.</p>

<p>All three of us looked keenly at the stranger
whose personality might mean so much to the
success of our plans and hopes. He was a thoroughly
representative specimen of our admirable
County police. A well-built man, in superb physical
condition, good-looking and intelligent. I summed
him up at once as a man who would be inflexible
in the exercise of his duty, and alert in detecting
any suspicious circumstance; in fact, a difficult
man to hoodwink, and impossible to corrupt had
anyone wished to do so.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, I was encouraged by something
in his face that suggested the influence of routine.
It was not the face of an imaginative man. This<span class="pagenum" id="Page_289">[289]</span>
was not the detective of fiction, nor even one of
those choicer spirits of Scotland Yard to whom
no combination of circumstances is so improbable
as to appear incredible. I trusted that it might
be impossible to Sergeant Moore, confronted with
a bishop and a magistrate, to suspect them of
complicity in the vice of an obscure Oriental criminal.</p>

<p>When the introductions were completed, Sergeant
Moore himself proceeded to explain.</p>

<p>“I am very sorry to intrude, my Lord and gentlemen,”
he began, “we would not have troubled
you if we could have helped it. But the fact is
I have a warrant to execute, and Constable Davis
has seen a man answering the description coming here
just before I arrived. To avoid troubling you, sir,
I have had the house watched so as to take him
when he came out. But as it was getting dark
and he did not appear I became anxious, and thought
you would excuse me coming in to arrest him
here, though I know it must be unpleasant.”</p>

<p>“I hope none of us are wanted, sergeant?”
Edmund enquired jokingly.</p>

<p>“No, sir,” replied the sergeant with a smile.
“No, it is some kind of a foreigner from Egypt,
name of Osman. He was one of the crew of a steamer
that made Southampton last night. He managed
to give us the slip there, but we had no difficulty
in tracing him to Brighton, as he took the train there,
and the young man in the ticket office remembered
his way of speaking. I came on to Brighton with
two men in a car and we lost the scent there, but
we heard of a foreigner being seen on this road
in the afternoon. Fortunately, Constable Davis
here noticed him and followed him to this house.
He naturally thought it was all right when he
saw him let in. I hope he is still here, sir.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_290">[290]</span>“I left him in the next room, having some food,”
I said. “He was my guide, or dragoman, during
a recent trip in Egypt, and came here asking for
money, as he said he was destitute and knew
no one else in England.”</p>

<p>Sergeant Moore looked much relieved.</p>

<p>“I think it will be best if we go and slip these
on at once,” he said, producing a pair of handcuffs.
“Davis and I will just slip in quietly, and get him
unawares. He is said to be a dangerous character,
and I don’t want any disturbance in the house.”</p>

<p>“By all means,” I said, “I will show you the
room.”</p>

<p>“I had better go and bear a hand, in case you
want any help,” Edmund said, rising.</p>

<p>The sergeant looked approvingly at his athletic
form and thanked him.</p>

<p>“I suppose there is no doubt of this being the
right man?” I hazarded.</p>

<p>“He is certainly the man referred to in my instructions.
If you don’t mind we’ll go at once, and
very quietly, please. I will go first and get on
the far side of him; Davis, you follow and grip
him, and look out for a knife. These fellows are
handy with them.”</p>

<p>We all rose, the bishop, who had not spoken,
following us to the door.</p>

<p>We stepped noiselessly across the carpeted hall,
and I pointed out the door of the morning-room,
my heart beating almost as fast as though Jakoub
had still been there in fact.</p>

<p>Sergeant Moore opened the door and slipped
inside, followed closely by Davis. I heard an oath
of extreme impropriety from the sergeant, followed
by the shrill sound of his whistle.</p>

<p>We followed them into the room, and found<span class="pagenum" id="Page_291">[291]</span>
both policemen leaning out of the open window.
Sergeant Moore blew another blast on his whistle,
and then turned round, his face flushed with vexation.</p>

<p>“He has done us again, sir. For the present,
that is—bolted through the window! Halt there!”
he cried, looking out of the window again as a
constable came round from the front in response
to the whistle. “Get your bull’s-eye going, and
come carefully up to the window, but don’t pass
it. Look for tracks of someone leaving the house
this way.”</p>

<p>Here was something I had not foreseen.</p>

<p>The turf of the lawn came right up to the house
on this side, but to the trained eyes of these men
the total absence of any vestige of a man’s jumping
out would be intensely suspicious. They would
be bound to search the house. They would find
the entrance to the passage, and traces there. How
then could they avoid the conclusion that I had
connived at the man’s escape?</p>

<p>While these thoughts passed through my mind
the constable had lighted his lamp and reconnoitred
the ground.</p>

<p>“There’s two heel-marks here,” he now reported,
still stooping with his lantern, “somebody has
jumped down within the last few minutes. I can
see a track across the lawn where the dew has
been brushed off the grass.”</p>

<p>“Follow it carefully,” said the sergeant, “but
keep off it. Don’t foul it.”</p>

<p>For a moment I was bewildered at this information.
Who, I wondered, had made these tracks,
since Jakoub had not? Then I caught a faint
smile of understanding on Edmund’s face, and I
realised that Bates was a much cleverer man than<span class="pagenum" id="Page_292">[292]</span>
myself, that he possessed what Ruskin calls “imagination
penetrative.”</p>

<p>“Somebody has been through the fence here,”
said the constable from the far side of the lawn.</p>

<p>“Wait for me, then,” the sergeant replied, lowering
himself out of the window. Beyond the fence
was a private footpath, hard as iron in this weather,
where Bates’s footprints leading back to the kitchen
entrance would be quite invisible. In the other
direction the path led on to the high-road.</p>

<p>“Excuse me, gentlemen,” said the sergeant as
he reached the ground, “but I’d be obliged if you
would be careful not to disturb anything in that
room until I have a chance to examine it.”</p>

<p>“Certainly,” I said, “we are going to my study
where you will find us if you have time to return,
or if we can help you in any way.”</p>

<p>I had a hasty look round the room. Jakoub’s
half-finished meal was there. Otherwise it was
exactly as usual. I could conceive of nothing there
that could suggest the truth to the most acute
mind. Even if it were possible to leave traces
on a carpet, these must all be obliterated since five
of us had passed in and out.</p>

<p>I saw Edmund also looking round with a searching
eye, and then we adjourned to the study.</p>

<p>The sense of guilt and even shame was stronger
in me than I had anticipated, and I am sure the
others felt likewise, for we all three sat silent and
uneasy, as if we had suddenly become strangers
to each other, as indeed in a sense we had.</p>

<p>The bishop was the first to break the silence
which we all felt tightening round us like a cord,
and I was thankful to him. There are situations
in which people who allow themselves to drift into
silence prolonged beyond a certain limit are powerless<span class="pagenum" id="Page_293">[293]</span>
to regain the mutual confidence of normal
speech. I am sure it was to prevent this happening
in our case that he enquired of Edmund what he
thought Welfare’s present plan would be.</p>

<p>“I should think he will probably double back
towards Brighton along the beach. Of course, he
has no idea in which direction the police will search,
and back towards Brighton is perhaps the least
likely. It is bad going on the beach, but on the stones
he would leave no track. Somewhere before
reaching Brighton he would have to leave the coast,
strike inland and find a hiding-place before morning.
He is sure to make for London. Jakoub
is too conspicuous in the country. They will have
to travel at night and find a hiding-place for Jakoub
during the day. It will take them the best part
of three nights to reach London.”</p>

<p>“Do you think they have much chance of eluding
the police?” the bishop asked.</p>

<p>“I think they will, because Welfare can move
about as he likes in the daytime. He can get
provisions and reconnoitre. If they had any
idea that Jakoub had a companion, and had a
description of him, it would be almost impossible,
as of course every village constable will be warned
before morning.”</p>

<p>“Welfare might find a boat,” I suggested.</p>

<p>“Too risky,” Edmund opined, “the boat would
be missed, and even if they sank it and swam
ashore the police would be able to concentrate
their attention on the coast. Welfare will see that
the police have a bigger job to cover the whole
country.”</p>

<p>This discussion of the possible plans and chances
of the fugitives was quite an agreeable diversion
and greatly relieved the tension of our feelings<span class="pagenum" id="Page_294">[294]</span>
until Sergeant Moore rejoined us, looking irritated
and crestfallen.</p>

<p>“I have just called to say we can find no trace
of him beyond your hedge, not in this light, sir.
I wonder if you have such a thing as a road map
of these parts, sir?”</p>

<p>“Certainly, sergeant. Won’t you sit down?”</p>

<p>“No, thank you, sir, I must get back to the
station and spend the night on the telephone. It’s
all we can do until morning.”</p>

<p>I spread a map on the desk, and we bent over
it together, Edmund looking over my shoulder.</p>

<p>Sergeant Moore made a few hurried measurements
of places within twenty miles of my house which I
located for him on the map.</p>

<p>“Thank you, sir,” he said, “I think it won’t be
difficult to put a ring round him before morning. I
think you said he doesn’t know the country at all,
sir?”</p>

<p>“As far as I know he has never been in England
before. But he seemed to find his way here all
right.”</p>

<p>“Of course he had your address?”</p>

<p>“Oh yes. He got that from the hotel I stopped
at in Egypt.”</p>

<p>“You would call him an intelligent man?”</p>

<p>“Very. He was an admirable guide in the
desert.”</p>

<p>“And he speaks English well?”</p>

<p>“Perfectly. Of course he expresses himself in a
peculiar way, but he understands everything. I
wish I could speak Arabic as well!” I added with a
sigh.</p>

<p>“May I just read over the description I have of
him? You could perhaps tell me if it corresponds
with the man you know.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_295">[295]</span>He read the description. Within its formal
limits it was an accurate portrait of Jakoub, but I was
able to add some details as to his present costume
for which the sergeant thanked me.</p>

<p>“I think that’s all,” he said, pocketing his notebook;
“I am exceedingly sorry for disturbing his
lordship and you gentlemen.”</p>

<p>I felt a sense of intense relief, for I had feared
every moment that the man might ask some question
which would embarrass me, and perhaps lead
me to arouse suspicion. But it was clear that the
whole story seemed perfectly natural and true to
the sergeant. The idea of cross-examination had
never occurred to him. The bishop rose and offered
his hand with his peculiar winning grace.</p>

<p>“Good-night, sergeant,” he said, “don’t think you
have disturbed us in the least. It is not often that
we clergymen have an opportunity of seeing the
actual work of such men as you. I have been
intensely interested in the whole affair, and greatly
impressed by your zeal and capacity. I fear we
don’t always realise how much we owe to our
indefatigable defenders.”</p>

<p>“Thank you, my lord,” said the sergeant, flushing
with pleasure at this unwonted praise from so high
a quarter.</p>

<p>As he left the room with a final salute the bishop
rather wearily resumed his seat.</p>

<p>“That,” he said, passing a hand over his brow,
“is the one man we have really wronged throughout
this very painful transaction.”</p>

<p>I thought of my poor friend Brogden, but I did
not remind the bishop of him.</p>

<p>I had dreaded the interview with the police, but
now that it was over, now that we seemed to have
achieved our purpose, I felt none of the elation<span class="pagenum" id="Page_296">[296]</span>
of complete relief. The sergeant’s confidence in
his ability “to make a ring round Jakoub” alarmed
me, and I knew that I should have no sense of
security until we heard from Welfare of his safety,
until, in fact, Jakoub was out of the country,
and I could believe that the hunt for him was at
an end.</p>

<p>We formed a gloomy trio, disinclined to talk, yet
unwilling to separate and retire to bed. I do
not think my conscience was uneasy, but to the
strongest mind I suppose there must be something
strangely upsetting in finding oneself opposed
to law and the commonly accepted standards of
conduct.</p>

<p>I am sure I was not the only member of the party
who felt this influence.</p>

<p>We continued for a long time in desultory talk
with intervals of embarrassed silence.</p>

<p>It was after such a pause that my restlessness
got the better of me, and going to the window I
drew aside the curtains.</p>

<p>The full moon was high in the heavens approaching
the meridian. It still rode in a clear sky, though
to my surprise I saw a great bank of cloud towering
swiftly upwards from the west, though the sun
had set without any sign of an end to the long
spell of summer drought we had experienced.</p>

<p>“It looks as if the weather is going to break,”
I remarked, still looking out.</p>

<p>I heard Edmund rise and tap the aneroid on
the mantelpiece.</p>

<p>“The glass is coming down with a run,” he said,
then he and the bishop joined me at the window.</p>

<p>We stood there in silence, wrapt in contemplation
of the splendour of the moonlight. Beneath it
the channel appeared as a silver background to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_297">[297]</span>
the black silhouette of trees. A faint flush was
reflected from the red roofs of houses in the village.
The lawn before us was a silver mystery woven of
a myriad threads of dew-besprinkled gossamer,
and flowers looked up with pallid, unfamiliar faces
to the sky.</p>

<p>The lustre of the stars near the triumphant
moon was dimmed, but low down in the south-east
I could see the lovely constellation Scorpio, like a
diamond pendant with a topaz heart.</p>

<p>Even the corncrakes were hushed, and nothing
stirred on earth or in the air around us. The only
movement was the majestic advance of the vast
cloud spreading from the west, threatening an
invasion of “the Peace of God which passeth all
understanding.” Standing thus with our backs
to the room, we were all unaware of Bates’s entrance
until he was close behind us.</p>

<p>“I beg your pardon, sir,” he said, almost in a
whisper.</p>

<p>I turned to see his face, looking white in the
moonlight, and with a perturbed expression very
unusual in him.</p>

<p>“What is it, Bates?” I asked.</p>

<p>“There seems to be someone wanting to get
into the cellar from the passage. I think it must
be that native come back, sir. I thought I had
better take your instructions before opening the
door.”</p>

<p>We turned back into the room at once, all three
of us at a loss before this shock of the totally unexpected.
The immediate return of Jakoub was
something I had never contemplated. In the
attempt to rearrange my ideas I was speechless.</p>

<p>“Why do you think he is there?” I heard
Edmund asking, “tell us what has happened.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_298">[298]</span>“Mrs. Rattray thought she heard a tapping in
the cellar, sir. She has been very nervous about
this man being in the house, and terribly upset
at the police coming and the man’s escape. She
said she wouldn’t sleep a wink all night. I thought
it was her nerves when she said she heard something,
so I went down and listened. I told her it was
nothing and got her off to bed. But there was
somebody there, sir, and he has just been tapping
again, very gentle and careful like.”</p>

<p>“We must let him in, of course,” Edmund said,
looking at me. I nodded.</p>

<p>“I will go,” he added, “and, Bates, you had
better come and bring a light. But keep well
behind me. There is no saying what he will be
up to this time.”</p>

<p>“I shall go with you, too,” the bishop said.</p>

<p>“Let us all go,” I pleaded, “but we must make
no noise. Mrs. Rattray must not hear us.”</p>

<p>“One moment,” said Edmund. He slipped out
of the room and returned almost at once with a
leather plaited “life preserver” which always
accompanied him.</p>

<p>Without another word we crept down to the
kitchen. Bates took an oil lamp from the table
and lighted us down the cellar steps. As we descended
I distinctly heard three gentle taps at
the door.</p>

<p>Slowly and almost noiselessly Edmund worked
back the bolts, then throwing the door open he
stepped quickly backwards, and stood with his
left foot forward, the life preserver in his hand
poised ready for a blow.</p>

<p>But Jakoub made no rush.</p>

<p>A hoarse weak voice asked, “Are the police
gone?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_299">[299]</span>Bates raised the lamp, and peering through the
door I saw a figure sitting huddled on the step
that led down into the underground passage.</p>

<p>“Welfare!” Edmund exclaimed.</p>

<p>I recognised Welfare’s slab of a face, blanched
and shrunken. A blood-soaked scarf was knotted
round his head. One side of his face, his neck,
and one shoulder, were plastered with blood congealed
in jelly-like masses.</p>

<p>“Are they gone?” he asked again.</p>

<p>“Yes, long ago,” said Edmund stooping down
to raise him.</p>

<p>“That’s all right then,” Welfare answered.
“Steady; I’ve been faint for a bit, losing blood
from a cut in the head. Bleeding’s stopped now
I think, but I don’t want to start it again. Let
me get on my knees. That’s it.”</p>

<p>Slowly and painfully on hands and knees he
crawled into the cellar, and managed to sit on the
floor. I had not known a man could lose so much
blood and live. I feared I should be sick, and I
saw the bishop’s face turn grey, but he did not speak.</p>

<p>“Let’s have a look,” said Edmund quietly,
busying himself with the knot in the scarf.</p>

<p>“Three or four stitches,” said Welfare, “will
stop it breaking out again. You’ll find a doctor’s
bent needle and some gut in the little case in my
right-hand pocket. Then you can wash it, and cut
away these clothes. I’ll be all right in a few
minutes.”</p>

<p>“Hadn’t he better have some brandy?” I asked.</p>

<p>“Not till I get the stitches in,” Edmund said
with decision. “It would only start the bleeding.
I think, my lord, you and my brother had better
leave us. Bates and I will get him upstairs in a
bit.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_300">[300]</span>We were evidently useless. As we turned to go
we met Bates coming down the stairs with a basin
and jug of water, a sponge, towels, cotton wool
and bandages. I realised the hopelessness of my
even giving directions to one so much more capable
than myself.</p>

<p>For half an hour the bishop and I hovered uneasily
in the smoking-room, listening to every sound that
came from the cellar below. It had been impossible
to question the sorely wounded man about
Jakoub, but the same dread, the same horror,
was in both our minds. Jakoub in his madness
had wounded Welfare and escaped. Already I
believed he must have run blindly into the trap
prepared for him. Nothing now could explain my
action in concealing him from the police, and the
bishop himself could hardly escape aspersion.</p>

<p>At last we heard slow steps ascending the cellar
stairs.</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_301">[301]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XVIII<br>

<small>HOW JAKOUB WAS NO MORE SEEN</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">CAPTAIN WELFARE came in leaning on
Edmund, who helped him into an arm-chair.</p>

<p>His head was neatly bandaged, and
he was clad in a dressing-gown. He was still
evidently weak, although largely restored from
the pitiable object that had crawled into the cellar.</p>

<p>The bishop and I hastened to commiserate him,
and I suggested his going straight to bed.</p>

<p>“No, thank you, sir,” he said, leaning back in
the chair. “I’m better now. I shall be all right
in a few minutes. Your man is getting me something
to drink. Anyhow I <i>must</i> keep on my
legs for a bit. There’s a deal to be settled and
done to-night.”</p>

<p>“Where is Jakoub?” I ventured to ask at last.</p>

<p>“I don’t think you will blame me, sir, or his
lordship either, when I tell you about it. He
came at me like a leopard. As you know, I meant
him no harm.”</p>

<p>“I know you did not, captain. We are so far
from blaming you that we are only sorry you should
have been so hurt. It was a dastardly attack.”</p>

<p>“Aye. A proper dago’s trick,” said Welfare.
He paused to sip a glass of hot milk and brandy
which he had prescribed for himself, and which certainly
seemed to revive him in a remarkable degree.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_302">[302]</span>“It was quite dark in that passage,” he continued.
“I stood about half way up it, wondering
would you have got my message. It seemed a
long time waiting, but at last I heard the door open
and shut, and then footsteps coming very quietly
on. I flashed an electric torch to show I was
there, and the footsteps stopped. I waited, and
then as I heard no more I went up the passage
searching it with the torch.</p>

<p>“Presently I saw someone crouching at the
side. ‘Is that Jakoub?’ I asked, but there
was no answer. ‘It’s all right,’ I said, ‘it’s me,
Captain Ringrose,’ which was the name he knew
me by. Then he seemed to take a little run,
stooping like an animal; I saw the glint of a knife,
and he was on me. I don’t rightly know how
things happened then. Them natives always strike
at your neck. Either I ducked or I happened
to knock his hand up, but I felt the knife ripping
my scalp. ‘You rob me, devil, I kill you,’ he
says in a kind of snarl, as I closed on him, and
then by good luck I got his wrist in my left hand.
He twisted round me like a snake, but I used my
weight and crushed him against the side of the
passage. I knew he was struggling to get the knife
in his other hand. He gave another twist and
was almost free, but I managed to hold his wrist,
and I felt both bones of his arm snap, but that
didn’t quieten him, and then I got my right hand
on his throat.</p>

<p>“I knew my strength would go in a minute
with the blood I was losing, and if I didn’t quiet
him I was done for. I felt him stiffen like a steel
spring as I gripped his throat. Then a buzzing
came in my ears. He went limp like, and we fell
together, me still holding him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_303">[303]</span>“I suppose the fainting stopped my bleeding
for a bit. Anyhow I came to, and Jakoub was
still there half under me. He wasn’t breathing,
and the blood started pumping out of my cut
again, so I knotted my scarf as tight as I could
over it and kept quiet to give it a chance of stopping.
I felt about for the torch and found it,
but it was broken. I was very giddy and sick,
and I think I went over again. I seemed to be
there a long while in the dark, and Jakoub never
stirred. I put a hand on his face. His mouth
was open, and his cheeks were dead cold.”</p>

<p>Captain Welfare paused, exhausted by his long
statement. Nobody spoke, or questioned him
while he took another drink. The end of the
story was already clear to us, and Edmund, of
course, had already been told. The long intrigue
of infamy had ended in battle, murder and sudden
death.</p>

<p>Captain Welfare was evidently distressed at our
silence, interpreting it as meaning condemnation.</p>

<p>“I think, gentlemen,” he continued, “you will
see it was self-defence. I didn’t mean him no
harm, I was there to help him. But he meant
doing me in right enough, and very nearly did.
I could do nothing for him myself, but I tried
to get help for him in case there was a chance
still. I started to crawl for the house, as I thought,
but I had lost my bearings, and when I came
round a bend I saw the moonlight at the other
end of the passage. Then the bleeding broke
out again and I had to wait. Half an hour I should
think I waited, and when I got back to Jakoub
there was no mistake about it any more. He was
dead right enough. But I swear, my lord, if I never
speak another word, it was self-defence. I didn’t<span class="pagenum" id="Page_304">[304]</span>
mean to kill him. I didn’t want to kill him. What
did he want to kill me for?”</p>

<p>“As far as I am concerned,” said the bishop,
“I accept your word absolutely. It is a heavy
misfortune, especially for you, but there is certainly
no blame attaching to you. If I remember rightly
the wretched man said something about you just
as he left us.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Edmund, “‘this is a trap of Captain
Ringrose,’ or something of that sort.”</p>

<p>“He always thought that I was against him.
I had to watch him, and I often caught him out
trying to cheat us.”</p>

<p>“But all this must have happened hours ago,
Welfare,” I exclaimed, “why did you wait so long?”</p>

<p>“Why, you see, sir, it took me a long time to
get to this end of the passage. When I got to
the door I did not know whether the police would
be in the house or not. I thought, if I try to get
in while they are there we shall all be ruined. So
I determined to wait until—well, until I was really
afraid I could not afford to bleed any more. But
I’ll be all right now. The question is, what are
we to do about it?”</p>

<p>“Unless we decide to own up to the whole
thing,” Edmund argued, “we shall have to carry
him out and leave him under the cliff. They will
think he has fallen over in the dark.”</p>

<p>Welfare shook his head slowly.</p>

<p>“That would not do,” he said, “I could not see
him in the dark, but there will be no mistake
about the marks I have left on his throat. It
wouldn’t take a doctor to tell he was strangled.
They would be bound to trace back to the passage,
and then ask how he got there and who killed
him.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_305">[305]</span>An idea came into my mind, but I forbore to
utter it. It seemed to me to come in the guise
of temptation; temptation to use this catastrophe
to further our own ends.</p>

<p>“We might take a boat and bury him at sea,”
Welfare suggested.</p>

<p>This was so like my own idea, that I looked
around to see how the others took it. The bishop
had been sitting in silent meditation. He now
rose, and stood with his hands clasped behind
him looking down on us with an expression of
great sadness.</p>

<p>“Why not bury him where he is?” he asked.
It was my own idea, and I gasped to hear it propounded
by him.</p>

<p>“This wretched man’s life,” he continued, “was
forfeit to the law. Had the law taken him alive
the law could only have slain him. That has
been done as a result of his own wickedness and
folly. Of what use is it to hand over his dead
body to the law? He wrought enough mischief in
his life. His dead body would but work more. It
would involve some at least of us in utter ruin at the
hands of the law. A ruin that none has deserved in
such measure. I counsel you, Davoren, to let the
wretched business end here. The man was not of
our faith, so could not claim Christian burial or consecrated
ground. But he was a human being and
shall not be buried like a dog.”</p>

<p>There was again silence among us, a silence quickened
with apprehension. It became clear to me
that the idea that had germinated in my own
mind had only seemed to be tainted with guilt
because my soul was not seated high enough for
clear moral judgment. The intrinsic rightness of
the thing was manifest now that Parminter had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_306">[306]</span>
placed it in the clear light of an honest man’s independent
decision.</p>

<p>As it happened Welfare became our spokesman
and his primitive outlook on life was the one thing
needed to express the attitude of each one of us.</p>

<p>“If this seems the straight thing to your lordship,”
he said, “it’s good enough for me. I would
not have suggested it, because I seem to be coming
out too cheap. It wasn’t murder, because it
was self-defence. But I’d be bound to own up to
manslaughter.”</p>

<p>“Don’t you think, Captain Welfare, that you
ought to get to bed?” I asked. I was really
concerned about the man, but I wanted to get rid
of him too.</p>

<p>“Thank you, sir. But there is no need. If
you don’t mind, I’d rather see the job through
now.”</p>

<p>It was impossible for me to protest. After
all he was my guest. Nevertheless what I ought
to have regarded as his indomitable courage appeared
to me mere want of tact. His presence made
any communion between the bishop and myself
an utter impossibility. I wanted to talk to the
bishop alone and Welfare’s presence was something
I resented in a great tragic moment of my life. I
fear I suspected in him the love of the lower middle
class for anything in the nature of a funeral.</p>

<p>Edmund said nothing, but rang the bell.</p>

<p>When Bates came in he whispered to him, and
they left together. I knew they had gone to dig
Jakoub’s grave, and presently the thud of a pick-axe
and the sound of shovelling were conveyed
to us along the passage and through the floor.</p>

<p>It was weary waiting in that room, listening to
those dismal sounds, with Captain Welfare endlessly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_307">[307]</span>
repeating the same explanations, the same apologies.</p>

<p>Through the open window I heard a rustling in
the trees, and then a sudden puff of wind blew
the curtains inward and caused the lamp to flare.
The long-delayed storm had reached us and the
moon was blotted out. There was a sudden splash
of rain hard driven by the west wind. I rose to
shut the window, and looking out the thought came
to me that this darkness and confused rushing of
the wind was more natural for the passing of Jakoub’s
disordered soul than the serene tranquillity that
had preceded it. It was as though the west wind
had arisen to bear that soul back to the East where
alone it could be at home.</p>

<p>One o’clock had struck when Edmund came
back, soiled and perspiring, to tell us that all was
ready.</p>

<p>Captain Welfare insisted on accompanying us,
exhausted as he must have been, and he was helped
down the stairs by Edmund.</p>

<p>By the light of a stable lantern we made our
way for the last time along the fatal tunnel, and
found Bates awaiting us.</p>

<p>The grave was dug close to the far end of the
tunnel, and I marvelled at the immense amount
of earth that had been removed in little more than
an hour.</p>

<p>The body of Jakoub, shrouded in a white sheet,
lay on a board beside the grave with ropes in place
for lowering it.</p>

<p>The bishop took his place at the head of the
grave, facing his congregation of four.</p>

<p>“My friends,” he said, “this is a solemn moment
which must ever be present in the memory of each
of us. The wages of sin is death, and this our
brother, who was not the only sinner among us,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_308">[308]</span>
has paid the penalty. He has drawn his wages
in this world. That he may be the only one to
pay that penalty is a thought that should humble
us who are left behind. We are committing an
act for which we should certainly be condemned
by the laws of our country, but it is an act for
which I take full responsibility. I am sure that
it is not only expedient from the worldly point
of view, but that it is right. Because to act legally
in this matter would cause injustice to be done
in the name of justice. I therefore as a priest
absolve you from responsibility in this matter,
and I counsel you to pray for the forgiveness of
God for the wrong that each of us may have done.
Whether my judgment in this matter is right will
be proved by the event. If this night’s event
should bring any of you to lead a better life and
to serve God while you still have opportunity,
I shall be sure that my action has God’s blessing
upon it. This man has died in his sin and without
the faith that supports and consoles a Christian.
But it is not for us to place limits on the mercy
of Almighty God. Let us offer a silent prayer
that that mercy may be extended to this our
brother.”</p>

<p>As we continued in reverent silence round the
grave a pale gleam of moonlight faintly lit the
scene, throwing dark shadows across the excavation
and shining mournfully on the white wrapping
of the corpse that lay beside us.</p>

<p>Looking out through the opening of the tunnel
I saw as in a frame a portion of the sky. The
main body of the great storm cloud had passed,
and it was followed by a broken, hurrying rear-guard
of ragged clouds through which the moon seemed
to battle her way to the west, now submerged,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_309">[309]</span>
now showing pale and dim, like the terrified face
of a swimmer emerging between the waves of a
heavy sea.</p>

<p>At a sign from the bishop the body of Jakoub
was lowered into the grave. We threw a little
soil upon it with the customary words, “Earth
to earth, ashes to ashes, dust to dust.”</p>

<p>Then as the grave was filled in the bishop repeated
one verse from the funeral psalm: “For I am
a stranger with thee and a sojourner, as all my
fathers were,” and then pronounced the benediction.</p>

<p>Thus with reverence and as much ceremony as
is permitted by the rubric which prescribes that
“the office ensuing shall not be used for any that
die unbaptised or excommunicate,” the body
of Jakoub was committed to the earth, and his
stormy passage through life ended almost within
the precincts of my quiet Sussex vicarage.</p>

<p>As we parted for the night to get what rest we
could, I felt that my tranquillity was at last restored.
I could think almost kindly of Jakoub, for I believed
that with him had gone the malign influence that
had darkened Edmund’s life and threatened to
destroy his character.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XIX<br>

<small>CONCLUSION</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">I&#8202; HAVE done what I needed to do for my own
satisfaction by putting in the form of a consecutive
narrative the peculiar and perhaps
sometimes unseemly transactions which have now
been recorded.</p>

<p>I had only a fragmentary diary, occasional
notes of conversations written while the spoken
words were still fresh and vibrant in my memory,
and my own recollection of events.</p>

<p>I dreaded lest the latter might fade as I grew
older, and that loose leaves of manuscript might
be lost or destroyed before I had even in my own
mind a clear perspective of happenings that were
often so bewildering to me while I dwelt in the
midst of them.</p>

<p>I desire especially that Edmund’s children may
some day have an opportunity of appraising the
truth about their father’s youth, if it should happen
that any aspersions should ever be cast upon his
character. For I do believe in children knowing
the truth about their parents. Filial love, without
any opportunity for comparison and just criticism,
seems to me but a hollow tradition, liable to collapse
at the first whiff of truth.</p>

<p>I think no child of Edmund’s need ever be ashamed
of his father. His experience, his peculiar faculties
and personality, have enabled him to render very
signal and special services to his country in developing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_311">[311]</span>
the waterways of Africa. In all his letters to
me he apologises for the reputation he has gained,
which he says is entirely due to the practical
sagacity and knowledge of detail with which Welfare
supplies him. Edmund has already been presented
with a C.M.G., but Welfare’s name is unknown.</p>

<p>Yet I happen to know that Welfare is an exceedingly
contented man. In a recent letter he tells
me, “I am able to save a third of my pay, and
if I don’t marry at the finish I shall have a few
hundreds to leave where I shall die happy in leaving
it. I have the work I am suited with, under the
finest chief a man ever served. I have been baptised
into the Church out here, but not until I was able
to send a decent present to my father’s and my old
chapel. They tell me they have cut my name
on one of the stones in the wall ‘laid by Josiah
Welfare.’ Well, fancy!”</p>

<p>I reflected that I had never known Welfare’s
christian name before. But I was glad it was
engraved on the old dry-salter’s place of worship.</p>

<p>I have had a visit from Brogden, while he was
on leave. He told me that Jakoub’s disappearance
from my house had become one of the mysteries
not only of Egypt but of Scotland Yard.
I had hard work to resist the desire to confess,
but since that was impossible, I compounded by
installing a motor-car on my premises during
Brogden’s stay. When he had gone I sold the
atrocious thing at a heavy loss. But Brogden
had enjoyed himself, and the financial loss was
not enough to salve my conscience completely.</p>

<p>On the other hand, Bates resented the temporary
chauffeur, and Mrs. Rattray disliked him. Between
them they inflicted on me a penance which
I think straightens my moral account with Brogden.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_312">[312]</span>The penance might have been excessive only
that Edmund’s fiancée is the daughter of a fairly
near neighbour, an ex-commissioner under whom
Edmund had served. She is now constantly here
awaiting Edmund’s return. Bates and Mrs. Rattray
are completely subjugated by her. She settled
the matter of the chauffeur and got rid of him
with a minimum of friction.</p>

<p>She makes me desperately jealous of Edmund,
but I endeavour to realise that I belong to a bygone
generation, that I am become, in fact, a “dear old
thing.”</p>

<p>Jakoub’s bones are unlikely now to be disturbed.
They are honoured by having a vault as well as
a grave for their repose. For the smuggler’s
passage has been sealed up by solid masonry at
either end. It will never be opened again in my
lifetime, and I hope it is now closed for ever.</p>

<p>The bishop spent an evening with me recently,
and I showed him parts of this manuscript.</p>

<p>“As far as I know the story,” he said, “you
have been very accurate. When I look back upon
what has happened, especially on my own part
in the affair, I am reminded of a phrase of yours—‘I
can look my conscience in the face.’ What
a waste it would have been if your brother had
become a mere hanger-on to your charity, after
undergoing ‘prison discipline.’ Whenever I think
of him and of what might have happened to him,
I think of those words of the psalmist, ‘Though
ye have lien among the pots, yet shall ye be as
the wings of a dove, whose wings are covered
with silver, and her feathers like gold.’”</p>
